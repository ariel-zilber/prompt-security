Aguillard decision , which barred the teaching of creation science in public schools on constitutional grounds .From the mid-1990s , the intelligent design movement ( IDM ) , supported by the Discovery Institute , advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula .This led to the 2005 Kitzmiller v.
